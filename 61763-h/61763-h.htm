<h3 class='c003'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>

<p class='c008'>Published anonymously in one 8vo vol. of 378 pages (1807) with the following
title-page: ‘A Reply to the Essay on Population, by the Rev. T. R. Malthus.
In a Series of Letters. To which are added, Extracts from the Essay; with
notes. London: Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, Paternoster
Row. 1807.’ The volume was printed by Arliss and Huntsman, 32 Gutter
Lane, Cheapside.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ADVERTISEMENT</h3>

<p class='c008'>The three first of the following letters appeared originally in Cobbett’s
Weekly Political Register. There are several things, in which they
may seem to require some apology. First, some persons, who were
convinced by the arguments, have objected to the style as too flowery,
and full of attempts at description. If I have erred in this respect,
it has been from design. I have indeed endeavoured to make my
book as amusing as the costiveness of my genius would permit. If
however these critics persist in their objection, I will undertake to
produce a work as dry and formal as they please, if they will undertake
to find readers. Secondly, some of the observations may be
thought too severe and personal. In the first place, I shall answer
that the abuse, of which there is to be sure a plentiful sprinkling, is
not I think unmerited or unsupported; and in the second place,
that if I could have attacked the works successfully, without attacking
the author, I should have preferred doing so. But the thing was
impossible. Whoever troubles himself about abstract reasonings, or
calm, dispassionate inquiries after truth? The public ought not to
blame me for consulting their taste. As to the diffuseness, the
repetitions, and want of method to be found in these letters, I have no
good defence to make. I may however make the same excuse for
the great length to which they have run, as the Frenchman did, who
apologised for writing a long letter by saying, that he had not time to
write a shorter.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LETTER I<br /> <span class='large'>INTRODUCTORY</span></h3>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—As the proposed alteration in the system of the Poor Laws
must naturally engage your attention, as well as that of the public;
and, as the authority of Mr. Malthus has often been referred to, and
has great weight with many people on this subject, it may not be amiss
to inquire, how far the reputation which that gentleman has gained,
as a moral and political philosopher, can be safely reposed on as the
foundation of any part of a system which is directed to objects of
national utility, and requires close, comprehensive, and accurate reasoning.
You, Sir, are not ignorant, that a name will do more towards
softening down prejudices, and bolstering up a crude and tottering
system, than any arguments whatever. It is always easier to quote
an authority than to carry on a chain of reasoning. Mr. Malthus’s
reputation may, I fear, prove fatal to the poor of this country. His
name hangs suspended over their heads, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</span></i>, like some baleful
meteor. It is the shield behind which the archers may take their
stand, and gall them at their leisure. He has set them up as a
defenceless mark, on which both friends and foes may exercise
their malice, or their wantonness, as they think proper. He has
fairly hunted them down, he has driven them into his toils, he has
thrown his net over them, and they remain as a prey to the first
invader, either to be sacrificed without mercy at the shrine of cold
unfeeling avarice, or to linger out a miserable existence under the
hands of ingenious and scientific tormentors.—There is a vulgar
saying, ‘Give a dog a bad name, and hang him.’ The poor seem to
me to be pretty much in this situation at present. The poor, Sir,
labour under a natural stigma; they are <em>naturally</em> despised. Their
interests are at best but coldly and remotely felt by the other classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of society. Mr. Malthus’s book has done all that was wanting to
increase this indifference and apathy. But it is neither generous nor
just, to come in aid of the narrow prejudices and hard-heartedness of
mankind, with metaphysical distinctions and the cobwebs of philosophy.
The balance inclines too much on that side already, without
the addition of false weights. I confess I do feel some degree of
disgust and indignation rising within me, when I see a man of Mr.
Malthus’s character and calling standing forward as the accuser of
those ‘who have none to help them,’ as the high-priest of ‘pride and
covetousness,’ forming selfishness into a regular code, with its codicils,
institutes and glosses annexed, trying to muffle up the hand of charity
in the fetters of the law, to suppress ‘the compunctious visitings of
nature,’ to make men ashamed of compassion and good-nature as folly
and weakness, ‘laying the flattering unction’ of religion to the conscience
of the riotous and luxurious liver, and ‘grinding the faces of
the poor’ with texts of scripture. Formerly the feelings of compassion,
and the dictates of justice were found to operate as correctives
on the habitual meanness and selfishness of our nature: at present this
order is reversed; and it is discovered that justice and humanity are
not obstacles in the way of, but that they are the most effectual
strengtheners and supporters of our prevailing passions. Mr. Malthus
has ‘admirably reconciled the old quarrel between speculation and
practice,’ by shewing (I suppose in humble imitation of Mandeville)
that our duty and our vices both lean the same way, and that the ends
of public virtue and benevolence are best answered by the meanness,
pride, extravagance, and insensibility of individuals. This is certainly
a very convenient doctrine; and it is not to be wondered at, that it
should have become so fashionable as it has.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>While the prejudice infused into the public mind by this gentleman’s
writings subsists in its full force, I am almost convinced that
any serious attempt at bettering the condition of the poor will be
ineffectual. The only object at present is to gain time. The less it
is meddled with either with good or bad intentions, the better.
Tampering with the disease ‘will but skin and film the ulcerous part,
while foul corruption, mining all within, infects unseen.’ I have not
confidence enough either in the integrity, the abilities, or the power
of our state-doctors to be willing to trust it entirely in their hands.
They risk nothing, if they fail. The patient is in too desperate a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>state to bring any imputation on their skill; and after all, it is only
trying experiments <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in corpore vili</span></i>. The only thing they need be afraid
of is in reality doing <em>too much</em> good. This is the only error which
would never be forgiven by those whose resentment they have most
reason to dread. This however there will be no danger of. The
state of public feeling, the dispositions of individuals, the narrow
jealousy of parties, and the interests of the most powerful members of
the community will, I suspect, suffer little effectually to be done for
bettering the condition, exalting the character, enlightening the understandings,
or securing the comforts, the independence, the virtue and
happiness of the lower classes of the people. But, I am not equally
sure that the means employed for this very purpose may not be made
a handle for stifling every principle of liberty and honour in the hearts
of a free people. It will be no difficult matter, as things are circumstanced,
under pretence of propriety and economy, to smuggle in the
worst of tyrannies, a principle of unrelenting, incessant, vexatious,
over-ruling influence, extending to each individual, and to all the
petty concerns of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is what strikes me on the first view of the subject. I would
ask, Is Mr. Whitbread sure of the instruments he is to employ in the
execution of his scheme? Is he sure that his managing partners in
this new political firm of opulent patronage will not play the game
into the hands of those whose views of government and civilization
are very different from his own? But it seems, that whether practicable,
or no, Mr. Whitbread must bring in a Poor Bill. The effect
of it appears to me to be putting the poor into the wardship of the
rich, to be doing away the little remains of independence we have
left, and making them once more what they were formerly, the vassals
of a wealthy aristocracy. For my own part, who do not pretend to
see far into things, and do not expect miracles from human nature, I
should wish to trust as little as possible to the liberality and enlightened
views of country squires, or to the <em>tender mercies</em> of justices of the
peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The example of Scotland is held out to us as a proof of the
beneficial effects of popular education, and we are promised all the
same advantages from the adoption of the same plan. The education
of the poor is the grand specific which is to cure all our disorders,
and make the leper whole again; and, like other specifics, it is to
operate equally on all constitutions and in all cases. But I may ask,
Is the education of the poor the only circumstance in which Scotland
differs from England? Are there no other circumstances in the
situation of this country that may render such a scheme impracticable,
or counteract its good effects, or render it even worse than nugatory?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Is knowledge in itself a principle of such universal and indisputable
excellence that it can never be misapplied, that it can never be made
the instrument and incentive to mischief, or that it can never be
mixed and contaminated with ‘baser matter’? Do not the peculiar
principles and discipline of the church of Scotland, does not the
traditional and habitual faith in the doctrines of religion, do not the
general manners not of the poor only, but of the other classes of
society, does not the state of cultivation, do not the employments of
the people, the absence of luxury, and temptation, the small number
of great towns, and the remains of ancient customs, tend to strengthen,
to forward, to give consistency to, and secure the good effects of
education? Or will Mr. Whitbread say that he can supply the
place of these with a beadle, a white wand, a spelling book, and a
primmer? Supposing it practicable, will the adoption of a general
plan of education have the same effect in our great manufacturing
towns, in our sea-ports, in the metropolis, that it has in the heart of
Scotland, or in the mountains of Cumberland? Will it not have the
contrary effect?</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not reading in the abstract, but the kind of reading they are
likely to meet with, and the examples about them leading them to
emulate the patterns of sobriety and industry, or of vice and profligacy
held out to them in books, that will do either good or harm to the
morals of a people. In the country the people read moral or religious,
or, at least, innocent books, and therefore, they are benefited by
them; in towns, they as often meet with licentious and idle publications,
which must do them harm. It is in vain to say that you will
give them <em>good</em> books, they will get <em>bad ones</em>. Will those hotbeds of
vice, the factories of Manchester, &amp;c., be less fruitful for having the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">farina</span></i> of knowledge sprinkled over them? Will not corruption
quicken faster, and spread wider for having this new channel opened
to it? Will a smattering in books, and the current pamphlets of the
day tend to quench and smother the flame of the passions, or will it
add fuel to them? I do not scruple to assert, that religion itself,
when it comes in contact with certain situations, may be highly
dangerous. It is the soil in which the greatest virtues and the
greatest vices take root. Where it has not strength to stop the
torrent of dissolute manners, it gives it additional force by checking
it; as the bow that has been bent the contrary way, recoils back
with tenfold violence. It is for this reason that the morals of the
people in the trading towns in the north of England are, I believe,
worse than they are farther south, because they are brought up more
religiously. The common people there are almost all of them originally
dissenters. Again, it may be asked, will the poor people in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>trading towns send their children to school instead of sending them to
work at a factory? Or will their employers, forgetting their own
interests, compel them to do it? Or will they give up their profits
and their wealth for the sake of informing the minds, and preserving
the morals of the poor? Oh! no. It may be replied, that it is
chiefly for the peasantry and country people, who compose the largest
part of the community, that this plan of education is intended. But
they are the very people who do not stand in need of it, and to
whom, if it does no harm, it will do little good. If working hard,
and living sparingly are the chief lessons meant to be inculcated in
their minds, they are already tolerably perfect in their parts. As for
the rest, it is in vain to attempt to make men any thing else but what
their situation makes them. We are the creatures not of knowledge,
but of circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>For all these reasons I cannot help looking at this general parallel
between the benefits derived from education in Scotland, and those
expected from it in this country as little better than a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">leurre de dupe</span></i>.
The advantages of education in the abstract are, I fear, like other
abstractions, not to be found in nature. I thought that the rage for
blind reform, for abstract utility, and general reasoning, had been
exploded long since. If ever it was proper, it was proper on general
subjects, on the nature of man and his prospects in general. But the
spirit of abstraction driven out of the minds of philosophers has
passed into the heads of members of parliament: banished from the
closets of the studious, it has taken up its favourite abode in the
House of Commons. It has only shifted its ground and its objects
according to the character of those in whom it is found. It has
dwindled down into petty projects, speculative details, and dreams of
practical, positive matter-of-fact improvement. These new candidates
for fame come in awkwardly holding up the train of philosophy;
and, like the squires of political romance, invite you to sit down with
them to the spoonfuls of whipt syllabub, the broken scraps of logic,
and the same banquet of windy promises which had been so much
more handsomely served up, and to satiety, by their masters.</p>

<p class='c011'>I know nothing of Mr. Whitbread personally. His character
stands fair with the public, for consistency and good intention. But
I cannot recognise in his plodding, mechanical, but ill-directed and
unsuccessful endeavours to bring to justice a great public delinquent,
in his flowery common-place harangues, or in the cold, philosophic
indifference of the sentiments he has expressed upon the present
occasion, either the genius, penetration, or generous enthusiasm,
(regulated, not damped by the dictates of reason) which shall be
equally proof against the artifices of designing men, against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>sanguine delusions of personal vanity, or the difficulties, the delays,
the disgust, and probable odium to be encountered in the determined
prosecution of such a task. The celebrated Howard fell a martyr to
the great cause of humanity in which he embarked. He plunged
into the depth of dungeons, into the loathsome cells of disease,
ignominy, and despair; he sacrificed health and life itself as a pledge
of the sincerity of his motives. But what proof has Mr. Whitbread
ever given of his true and undissembled attachment to the same
cause? What sacrifices has he made, what fatigues has he suffered,
what pain has he felt, what privation has he undergone in the pursuit
of his object, that he should be depended on as the friend and
guardian of the poor, as the dispenser of good or ill to millions of his
fellow-beings? The ‘champion’ should be the ‘child’ of poverty.
The author of our religion, when he came to save the world, took
our nature upon him, and became as one of us: it is not likely that
any one should ever prove the <em>saviour</em> of the poor, who has not
common feelings with them, and who does not know their weaknesses
and wants. To the officious inquiries of all others, What then are
we to do for them? The best answer would perhaps be, Let them
alone.—</p>

<p class='c011'>I return to the subject from which I set out, and from which I
have wandered without intending it; I mean the system of Mr.
Malthus, under the auspices of whose discoveries it seems the present
plan is undertaken, though it differs in many of its features from the
expedients recommended by that author. I am afraid that the parent
discovery may, however, in spite of any efforts to prevent it, overlay
the ricketty offspring. Besides, the original design and principle
gives a bias to all our subsequent proceedings, and warps our views
without our perceiving it. Mr. Malthus’s system must, I am sure,
ever remain a stumbling block in the way of true political economy,
as innate ideas for a long time confused and perplexed all attempts at
philosophy. It is an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i>, which can only beguile the thoughtless
gazer, and lead him into bogs and quicksands, before he knows
where he is. The details of his system are, I believe, as confused,
contradictory, and uncertain, as the system itself. I shall, however,
confine my remarks to the outlines of his plan, and his general principles
of reasoning. In these respects, I have no hesitation in saying
that his work is the most complete specimen of <em>illogical</em>, crude and
contradictory reasoning, that perhaps was ever offered to the notice
of the public. A clear and comprehensive mind is, I conceive,
shewn, not in the extensiveness of the plan which an author has
chalked out for himself, but in the order and connection observed in
the arrangement of the subject, and the consistency of the several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>parts. This praise is so far from being applicable to the reasoning of
our author, that nothing was ever more loose and incoherent. ‘The
latter end of his commonwealth always forgets the beginning.’ Argument
threatens argument, conclusion stands opposed to conclusion.
This page is an answer to the following one, and that to the next.
There is hardly a single statement in the whole work, in which he
seems to have had a distinct idea of his own meaning. The principle
itself is neither new, nor does it prove any thing new; least of all
does it prove what he meant it to prove. His whole theory is a
continued contradiction; it is a nullity in the science of political
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>I must, however, defer the proof of these assertions to another
letter, when, if you should deem what I have already said worthy
the notice of your readers, I hope to make them out to their and
your satisfaction.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>LETTER II<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE ORIGINALITY OF MR. MALTHUS’S PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT</span></h3>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—The English have been called a nation of philosophers; as I
conceive, on very slender foundations. They are indeed somewhat
slow and dull, and would be wise, if they could. They are fond of
deep questions without understanding them; and have that perplexed
and plodding kind of intellect, which takes delight in difficulties, and
contradictions, without ever coming to a conclusion. They feel most
interest in things which promise to be the least interesting. What is
confused and unintelligible they take to be profound; whatever is
remote and uncertain, they conceive must be of vast weight and
importance. They are always in want of some new and mighty
project in science, in politics, or in morality for the morbid sensibility
of their minds to brood over and exercise itself upon: and by the
time they are tired of puzzling themselves to no purpose about one
absurdity, another is generally ready to start up, and take its place.
Thus there is a perpetual restless succession of philosophers and
systems of philosophy: and the proof they give you of their wisdom
to-day, is by convincing you what fools they were six months before.
Their pretensions to solidity of understanding rest on the foundation
of their own shallowness and levity; and their gravest demonstrations
rise out of the ruins of others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus has for some time past been lord of the ascendant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>But I will venture to predict that his reign will not be of long duration.
His hour is almost come; and this mighty luminary, ‘who so
lately scorched us in the meridian, will sink temperately to the west,
and be hardly felt as he descends.’ It is not difficult to account for
the very favourable reception his work has met with in certain classes
of society: it must be a source of continual satisfaction to their minds
by relieving them from the troublesome feelings so frequently occasioned
by the remains of certain silly prejudices, and by enabling
them to set so completely at defiance the claims of ‘worthless
importunity in rags.’ But it is not easy to account for the attention
which our author’s reasonings have excited among thinking men,
except from a habit of extreme abstraction and over-refined speculation,
unsupported by actual observation or a general knowledge of
practical subjects, in consequence of which the mind is dazzled and
confounded by any striking fact which thwarts its previous conclusions.
There is also in some minds a low and narrow jealousy,
which makes them glad of any opportunity to escape from the contemplation
of magnificent scenes of visionary excellence, to hug
themselves in their own indifference and apathy, and to return once
more to their natural level. Mr. Malthus’s essay was in this respect
a nice <em>let-down</em> from the too sanguine expectations and overstrained
enthusiasm which preceded it. Else, how a work of so base
tendency, and so poorly glossed over, which strikes at the root of
every humane principle, and all the while cants about sensibility and
morality, in which the little, low, rankling malice of a parish-beadle,
or the overseer of a work-house is disguised in the garb of philosophy,
and recommended as a dress for every English gentleman to wear, in
which false logic is buried under a heap of garbled calculations, such
as a bad player might make at cribbage to puzzle those with, who
knew less of the game than himself, where every argument is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de
se</span></i>, and defeats its own purpose, containing both ‘its bane and antidote’
within itself, how otherwise such a miserable reptile performance
should ever have crawled to that height of reputation which it
has reached, I am utterly unable to comprehend. But it seems
Mr. Malthus’s essay was a <em>discovery</em>. There are those whom I have
heard place him by the side of Sir Isaac Newton, as both equally
great, the one in natural, the other in political philosophy. But
waving this comparison, I must confess, that were I really persuaded
that Mr. Malthus had made any discovery at all, there is so little
originality, and so much ill-nature and illiberality in the world, that I
should be tempted to overlook the large share of the latter which
Mr. Malthus possesses in common with the rest of mankind (and
which in him may probably be owing to ill-digestion, to a sickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>constitution, or some former distaste conceived against poverty) and
to consider him merely in the light of a man of genius. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multum
abludit imago.</span></i> Indeed I do not much see what there is to discover
on the subject, after reading the genealogical table of Noah’s
descendants, and knowing that the world is round. But even allowing
that there was something in the nature of the subject which threw
over it a veil of almost impenetrable obscurity, Mr. Malthus was not
the first who found out the secret. Whatever some of his ignorant
admirers may pretend, Mr. Malthus will not say that this was the
case. He has himself given us a list of authors, some of whom he
had read before, and some since the first publication of his Essay,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
who fully understood and clearly stated this principle. Among these
Wallace is the chief. He has not only stated the general principle
with the utmost force and precision, by pointing out the necessary
disproportion between the tendency in population and the tendency in
the means of subsistence to increase after a certain period, (and till
this period, namely till the world became <em>full</em>, I must contend in
opposition to Mr. Malthus that the disproportion would not be
<em>necessary</em>, but artificial); but what is most remarkable, he has
brought this very argument forward as an answer to the same schemes
of imaginary improvement, which the author of the Essay on population
first employed it to overturn.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> For it is to be remembered that
the use which our author has since made of this principle to shut up
the work-house, to <em>snub</em> the poor, to stint them in their wages, to
deny them any relief from the parish, and preach lectures to them on
the new-invented crime of matrimony, was an after-thought. His
first, his grand, his most memorable effort was directed against the
modern philosophy. It was the service his borrowed weapons did in
that cause, that sanctified them at all other purposes. I shall have
occasion by and by to examine how far the argument was a solid
one; at present I am only inquiring into the originality of the idea.
And here I might content myself with referring your readers to
Wallace’s work; or it might be sufficient to inform them that after
indulging in the former part of it in all the schemes of fancied
excellence and Utopian government, which Sir Thomas More and so
many other philosophers and speculators have endeavoured to establish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>he then enters into an elaborate refutation of them, by describing the
evils, ‘the universal confusion and perplexity in which all such
perfect forms of society must soon terminate, the sooner on account
of their perfection,’ from the principle of population, and as he
expresses it, ‘from these primary determinations in nature, a limited
earth, a limited degree of fertility, and the continual increase of
mankind.’ However, as it is probable that most of your readers may
not have the book within their reach, and as people do not like to
take these things upon trust, or from a mere general representation of
them, I must beg your insertion of the following extract from the
work itself; and though it is pretty long, yet as you, Sir, seem to be
of opinion with me that the subject of Mr. Malthus’s reputation is a
matter of no mean interest to the public, I am in hopes that you will
not think your pages misemployed in dissipating the illusion. As to
Mr. Malthus himself, if he is a vain man, he ought to be satisfied
with this acknowledgement of his importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But without entering further into these abstracted and uncertain
speculations, it deserves our particular attention, that as no government
which hath hitherto been established, is free from all seeds of
corruption, or can be expected to be eternal; so if we suppose a
government to be perfect in its original frame, and to be administered
in the most perfect manner, after whatever model we suppose it to
have been framed, such a perfect form would be so far from lasting
for ever, that it must come to an end so much the sooner on account
of its perfection. For, though happily such governments should be
firmly established, though they should be found consistent with the
reigning passions of human nature, though they should spread far and
wide; nay, though they should prevail universally, they must at last
involve mankind in the deepest perplexity, and in universal confusion.
For how excellent soever they may be in their own nature, they are
altogether inconsistent with the present frame of nature, and with a
limited extent of earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Under a perfect government, the inconveniences of having a
family would be so intirely removed, children would be so well
taken care of, and everything become so favourable to populousness,
that though some sickly seasons or dreadful plagues in particular
climates might cut off multitudes, yet in general, mankind would
encrease so prodigiously, that the earth would at last be overstocked,
and become unable to support its numerous inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How long the earth, with the best culture of which it is capable
from human genius and industry, might be able to nourish its
perpetually encreasing inhabitants, is as impossible as it is unnecessary
to be determined. It is not probable that it could have supported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>them during so long a period as since the creation of Adam. But
whatever may be supposed of the length of this period, of necessity
it must be granted, that the earth could not nourish them for ever,
unless either its fertility could be continually augmented, or by some
secret in nature, like what certain enthusiasts have expected from the
philosopher’s stone, some wise adept in the occult sciences, should
invent a method of supporting mankind quite different from any
thing known at present. Nay, though some extraordinary method of
supporting them might possibly be found out, yet if there was no
bound to the increase of mankind, which would be the case under
a perfect government, there would not even be sufficient room for
containing their bodies upon the surface of the earth, or upon any
limited surface whatsoever. It would be necessary, therefore, in
order to find room for such multitudes of men, that the earth should
be continually enlarging in bulk, as an animal or vegetable body.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now since philosophers may as soon attempt to make mankind
immortal, as to support the animal frame without food; it is equally
certain, that limits are set to the fertility of the earth, and that its
bulk, so far as is hitherto known, hath continued always the same,
and probably could not be much altered without making considerable
changes in the solar system. It would be impossible, therefore, to
support the great numbers of men who would be raised up under a
perfect government; the earth would be overstocked at last, and the
greatest admirers of such fanciful schemes must foresee the fatal
period when they would come to an end, as they are altogether inconsistent
with the limits of that earth in which they must exist.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What a miserable catastrophe of the most generous of all human
systems of government! How dreadfully would the magistrates of
such commonwealths find themselves disconcerted at that fatal period,
when there was no longer any room for new colonies, and when the
earth could produce no further supplies! During all the preceding
ages, while there was room for increase, mankind must have been
happy; the earth must have been a paradise in the literal sense, as
the greatest part of it must have been turned into delightful and fruitful
gardens. But when the dreadful time should at last come, when
our globe, by the most diligent culture, could not produce what was
sufficient to nourish its numerous inhabitants, what happy expedient
could then be found out to remedy so great an evil?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In such a cruel necessity, must there be a law to restrain marriage?
Must multitudes of women be shut up in cloisters like the ancient
vestals or modern nuns? To keep a ballance between the two sexes,
must a proportionable number of men be debarred from marriage?
Shall the Utopians, following the wicked policy of superstition, forbid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>their priests to marry; or shall they rather sacrifice men of some
other profession for the good of the state? Or, shall they appoint
the sons of certain families to be maimed at their birth, and give a
sanction to the unnatural institution of eunuchs? If none of these
expedients can be thought proper, shall they appoint a certain number
of infants to be exposed to death as soon as they are born, determining
the proportion according to the exigencies of the state; and pointing
out the particular victims by lot, or according to some established
rule? Or, must they shorten the period of human life by a law, and
condemn all to die after they had compleated a certain age, which
might be shorter or longer, as provisions were either more scanty or
plentiful? Or what other method should they devise (for an expedient
would be absolutely necessary) to restrain the number of
citizens within reasonable bounds?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Alas! how unnatural and inhuman must every such expedient be
accounted! The natural passions and appetites of mankind are
planted in our frame, to answer the best ends for the happiness both
of the individuals and of the species. Shall we be obliged to contradict
such a wise order? Shall we be laid under the necessity of
acting barbarously and inhumanly? Sad and fatal necessity! And
which, after all, could never answer the end, but would give rise to
violence and war. For mankind would never agree about such
regulations. Force, and arms, must at last decide their quarrels, and
the deaths of such as fall in battle, leave sufficient provisions for the
survivors, and make room for others to be born.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Thus the tranquillity and numerous blessings of the Utopian
governments would come to an end; war, or cruel and unnatural
customs, be introduced, and a stop put to the increase of mankind,
to the advancement of knowledge, and to the culture of the earth, in
spite of the most excellent laws and wisest precautions. The more
excellent the laws had been, and the more strictly they had been
observed, mankind must have sooner become miserable. The remembrance
of former times, the greatness of their wisdom and virtue,
would conspire to heighten their distress;<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and the world, instead
of remaining the mansion of wisdom and happiness, become the
scene of vice and confusion. Force and fraud must prevail, and
mankind be reduced to the same calamitous condition as at present.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Such a melancholy situation in consequence merely of the want
of provisions, is in truth more unnatural than all their present
calamities. Supposing men to have abused their liberty, by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>abuse, vice has once been introduced into the world; and that wrong
notions, a bad taste, and vicious habits, have been strengthened by
the defects of education and government, our present distresses may
be easily explained. They may even be called natural, being the
natural consequences of our depravity. They may be supposed to
be the means by which providence punishes vice; and by setting
bounds to the increase of mankind, prevents the earth’s being
overstocked, and men being laid under the cruel necessity of
killing one another. But to suppose that in the course of a
favourable providence, a perfect government had been established,
under which the disorders of human passions had been powerfully
corrected and restrained; poverty, idleness, and war banished; the
earth made a paradise; universal friendship and concord established,
and human society rendered flourishing in all respects; and that such
a lovely constitution should be overturned, not by the vices of men, or
their abuse of liberty, but by the order of nature itself, seems wholly
unnatural, and altogether disagreeable to the methods of providence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By reasoning in this manner, it is not pretended that ’tis unnatural
to set bounds to human knowledge and happiness, or to the
grandeur of society, and to confine what is finite to proper limits. It
is certainly fit to set just bounds to every thing according to its
nature, and to adjust all things in due proportion to one another.
Undoubtedly, such an excellent order, is actually established throughout
all the works of God, in his wide dominions. But there are
certain primary determinations in nature, to which all other things
of a subordinate kind must be adjusted. A limited earth, a limited
degree of fertility and the continual increase of mankind are three of
these original constitutions. To these determinations, human affairs,
and the circumstances of all other animals, must be adapted. In
which view, it is unsuitable to our ideas of order, that while the
earth is only capable of maintaining a determined number, the human
race should increase without end. This would be the necessary
consequence of a perfect government and education. On which
account it is more contrary to just proportion, to suppose that such a
perfect government should be established in such circumstances, than
that by permitting vice, or the abuse of liberty in the wisdom of
providence, mankind should never be able to multiply so as to be
able to overstock the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘From this view of the circumstances of the world, notwithstanding
the high opinion we have of the merits of Sir Thomas
More, and other admired projectors of perfect governments in ancient
or modern times, we may discern how little can be expected from
their most perfect systems.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>‘As for these worthy philosophers, patriots, and law-givers, who
have employed their talents in framing such excellent models, we
ought to do justice to their characters, and gratefully to acknowledge
their generous efforts to rescue the world out of that distress into
which it has fallen, through the imperfection of government. Sincere,
and ardent in their love of virtue, enamoured of its lovely form,
deeply interested for the happiness of mankind, to the best of their
skill, and with hearts full of zeal, they have strenuously endeavoured
to advance human society to perfection. For this, their memory
ought to be sacred to posterity. But if they expected their beautiful
systems actually to take place, their hopes were ill founded, and they
were not sufficiently aware of the consequences.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The speculations of such ingenious authors enlarge our views, and
amuse our fancies. They are useful for directing us to correct
certain errors at particular times. Able legislators ought to consider
them as models, and honest patriots ought never to lose sight of them,
or any proper opportunity of transplanting the wisest of their maxims
into their own governments, as far as they are adapted to their
particular circumstances, and will give no occasion to dangerous
convulsions. But this is all that can be expected. Though such
ingenious romances should chance to be read and admired, jealous
and selfish politicians need not be alarmed. Such statesmen need
not fear that ever such airy systems shall be able to destroy their
craft, or disappoint them of their intention to sacrifice the interests
of mankind to their own avarice or ambition. There is too powerful
a charm which works secretly in favor of such politicians, which will
for ever defeat all attempts to establish a perfect government. There
is no need of miracles for this purpose. The vices of mankind are
sufficient. And we need not doubt but providence will make use of
them, for preventing the establishment of governments which are by
no means suitable to the present circumstances of the earth.’ See

<p class='c011'>Here then we have not only the same argument stated; but stated
in the same connection and brought to bear on the very same subject
to which it is applied by the author of the Essay. The principle
and the consequences deduced from it are exactly the same. It
often happens that one man is the first to make a particular discovery
or observation, and that another draws from it an important inference of
which the former was not at all aware. But this is not the case in the
present instance. As far as general reasoning will go, it is impossible
that any thing should be stated more clearly, more fully and explicitly
than Wallace has here stated the argument against the progressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>amelioration of human affairs, from the sole principle of population.
‘So will his anticipation prevent Mr. Malthus’s discovery;’ for it
happens that Wallace’s book was published so long ago as the year
1761. As to the details of the Essay, I shall leave them to the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseurs</span></i>, not pretending to know much about the matter; but as to
the general principle or ground-work, I must contend that it was
completely pre-occupied: Mr. Malthus has no more pretentions to
originality on that score, than I or any one else would have, who
after having read Mr. Malthus’s work undertook to retail the
arguments contained in it and did it in words a little different from
his own.—‘Oh! but,’ I hear some one exclaim, ‘the geometrical
and arithmetical series! Has Wallace said any thing of them? did
he find them out, or was not this discovery reserved entirely for the
genius and penetration of Mr. Malthus?’ Why really I do not
know: whether after having brought his principle to light, he
christened it himself, is more than I can pretend to determine. It
seems to me sufficient for Wallace to have said that let the one ratio
increase as fast as it would, the other would increase much faster, as
this is all that is practically meant by a geometrical and arithmetical
series. I should have no objection to let Mr. Malthus have the honour
of standing godfather to another’s bantling (and Mr. Shandy was of
opinion that it was a matter of as great importance to hit upon a
lucky name for a child as to beget it) but that the technical phrase
he has employed as a convenient shorthand method of explaining the
subject, in reality applies only to one half of it. The gradual
increase applies only to the degree of cultivation of the earth, not
to the quantity. These two things are palpably distinct. It does
not begin to take place till the whole surface of the earth has been
cultivated to a certain degree, or only with respect to those parts of
it which have been cultivated. It is evident that while most of the
soil remained wholly unoccupied and uncultivated, (which must have
been the case for many ages after these two principles began to
operate, and is still the case in many countries) the power of increase
in the productions of the earth, and consequently, in the support of
population would be exactly in proportion to the population itself,
for there would be nothing more necessary in order to the earth’s
maintaining its inhabitants than that there should be inhabitants enough
to till it. In this case the cultivation of the earth would be limited by
the population, not the population by the state of the cultivation.
Where there was no want of room, and a power of transporting
themselves from place to place, which there would naturally be in
great continents, and in gradually increasing colonies, there could be
no want of subsistence. All that would be wanted would be power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to raise or gather the fruits which the earth had in store, which as
long as men were born with hands they would be always able to do.
If a certain extent of ground easily maintained a certain number of
inhabitants, they would only have to spread themselves over double
the surface to maintain double the number. The difficulty is not in
making more land maintain more men, but in making the same spot
of ground maintain a greater number than it did before. Thus Noah
might have taken possession of the three contiguous quarters of the
globe for himself and his three sons; and, if instead of having three
sons, he had had three hundred, there would, I believe, have been no
danger of their starving, but the contrary, from the rapid increase of
population. What I mean to shew is, that it is not true as a general
principle that the increase of population and the increase of subsistence
are necessarily disproportionate to each other, that the one is
in a geometrical, the other is in an arithmetical ratio; but, that in a
particular and very important view of the subject, the extent of
population is only limited by the extent of the earth, and that the
increase of the means of subsistence will be in proportion to the
greater extent of surface occupied, which may be enlarged as fast as
there are numbers to occupy it. I have been thus particular, because
mathematical terms carry with them an imposing air of accuracy and
profundity, and ought, therefore, to be applied strictly, and with the
greatest caution, or not at all. I should say, then, that looking at
the subject in a general and philosophical point of view, I do not
think that the expression of an arithmetical and geometrical series
applies: for, with respect to the extent of ground occupied, which is
one thing on which population depends, and in the first instance
always, this might evidently be increased in any ratio whatever, that
the increase of population would admit, until the earth was entirely
occupied; and after that there would be no room either for a
geometrical or arithmetical progression; it would be at an absolute
stand. The distinction is therefore confined to the degree of art and
diligence used in the cultivation of those parts which have been
already occupied. This has no doubt gone on at a very slow
kind of snail’s pace from the very first, and will I dare say continue
to do so. Or to adopt Wallace’s distinction, the increase of
population is either not restricted at all by the ‘limited nature of
the earth,’ or it is limited absolutely by it: it is only kept back
indefinitely by the ‘limited fertility’ of the earth; and it cannot be
said to be kept back necessarily by this, while there are vast tracts
of habitable land left untouched. Till there is no more room, and
no more food to be procured without extreme exertion and contrivance,
the arithmetical and geometrical ratios do not naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>begin to operate; and the gradual increase that might take place
after that period, is not in my opinion (who am no great speculator)
of sufficient importance to deserve a pompous appellation. I would,
therefore, rather stop there, because it will simplify the question.
Till the world is full, or at least till every country is full, that is,
maintains as many inhabitants as the soil will admit, namely, till it
can be proved satisfactorily that it might not by taking proper
methods be made to maintain double the number that it does, the
increase of mankind is not necessarily checked by the ‘limited
extent of the earth,’ nor by its ‘limited fertility,’ but by other
causes. Till then population must be said to be kept down, not by
the original constitution of nature, but by the will of man. Till
then, Mr. Malthus has no right to set up his arithmetical and
geometrical ratios upon the face of the earth, and say they are the
work of nature. You, Sir, will not be at a loss to perceive the
fallacy which lurks under the gloss which Mr. Malthus has here
added to Wallace’s text. His readers looking at his mathematical
scale will be apt to suppose, that population is a naturally growing
and necessary evil; that it is always encroaching on and straitening
the means of existence, and doing more harm than good: that its
pernicious effects are at all times and in all places equally necessary
and unavoidable; that it is at all times an evil, but that the evil
increases in proportion to the increase of population; and that, therefore,
there is nothing so necessary as to keep population down at all
events. This is the imperious dictate of nature, the grinding law of
necessity, the end and the fulfilling of the commandment. I do not
mean to say, that Mr. Malthus does not often shift his ground on
this subject, or that he is not himself aware of the deception. It is
sufficient for him that he has it to resort to, whenever he is in want
of it, that he has been able to throw dust in his readers’ eyes, and
dazzle them by a specious shew of accuracy; that he has made out
a bill of indictment against the principle of population as a common
nuisance in society, and has obtained a general warrant against it, and
may have it brought into court as a felon whenever he thinks proper.
He has alarmed men’s minds with confused apprehensions on the
subject, by setting before their eyes, in an orderly series, the malignant
nature and terrible effects of population, which are perpetually
increasing as it goes on: and they are ready to assent to every
scheme that promises to keep these dreadful evils at a distance from
them. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacro tremuere timore.</span></i> Every coward is planet-struck.’
But nothing of all this is the truth. Population is only an evil,
as Mr. Malthus has himself shewn, in proportion as it is excessive;
it is not a necessary evil, till the supply of food can, from natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>causes, no longer keep pace with it: till this is the case, no restraints
are necessary, and when this is the case, the same wholesome degree
of restraint, the same quantity of vice and misery, will operate equally
to prevent any tremendous consequences, whether the actual population
is great or small; that is, whether it is stopped only from
having reached the utmost limits prescribed by nature, or whether it
has been starved and crushed down long before that period by
positive, arbitrary institutions, and the perverse nature of man. But
this is entering upon a matter which I intended to reserve for another
letter in which I shall examine the force of the arguments which
Mr. Malthus has built upon this principle. At present, I have done
all that was necessary to the performance of the first part of my
engagement, which was to shew that Mr. Malthus had little claim to
the praise of originality.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—This excellent saying of a great man was never more strictly
applicable to any system than it is to Mr. Malthus’s paradox, and his
explanation of it. It seemed, on the first publication of the Essay on
Population, as if the whole world was going to be turned topsy-turvy,
all our ideas of moral good, and evil were in a manner confounded,
we scarcely knew whether we stood on our head or our heels: but
after exciting considerable expectation, giving us a good shake, and
making us a little dizzy, Mr. Malthus, does as we do when we shew
the children <em>London</em>,—sets us on our feet again, and every thing goes
on as before. The common notions that prevailed on this subject, till
our author’s first population-scheme tended to weaken them, were that
life is a blessing, and that the more people could be maintained in any
state in a tolerable degree of health, comfort and decency, the better:
that want and misery are not desirable in themselves, that famine is
not to be courted for its own sake, that wars, disease and pestilence
are not what every friend of his country or his species should pray for
in the first place: that vice in its different shapes is a thing, that the
world could do very well without, and that if it could be got rid of
altogether, it would be a great gain. In short, that the object both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of the moralist and politician was to diminish as much as possible the
quantity of vice and misery existing in the world: without apprehending
that by thus effectually introducing more virtue and happiness,
more reason and good sense, that by improving the manners of a
people, removing pernicious habits and principles of acting, or securing
greater plenty, and a greater number of mouths to partake of it, they
were doing a disservice to humanity. Then comes Mr. Malthus with
his octavo book, and tells us there is another great evil, which had
never been found out, or at least not sufficiently attended to till his
time, namely excessive population: that this evil was infinitely greater
and more to be dreaded than all others put together; and that its
approach could only be checked by vice and misery: that any increase
of virtue or happiness, was the direct way to hasten it on; and that in
proportion as we attempted to improve the condition of mankind, and
lessened the restraints of vice and misery, we threw down the only
barriers that could protect us from this most formidable scourge of
the species, population. Vice, and misery were indeed evils, but they
were absolutely necessary evils; necessary to prevent the introduction
of others of an incalculably, and inconceivably greater magnitude;
and that every proposal to lessen their actual quantity on which the
measure of our safety depended, might be attended with the most
ruinous consequences, and ought to be looked upon with horror. I
think, Sir, this description of the tendency and complexion of Mr.
Malthus’s first essay is not in the least exaggerated, but an exact and
faithful picture of the impression, which it made on every one’s mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>After taking some time to recover from the surprise and hurry into
which so great a discovery would naturally throw him, he comes
forward again with a large quarto, in which he is at great pains both
to say and unsay all that he had said in his former volume, and upon
the whole concludes, that population is in itself a good thing, that it is
never likely to do much harm, that virtue and happiness ought to be
promoted by every practicable means, and that the most effectual as
well as desirable check to excessive population is <em>moral restraint</em>.
The mighty discovery, thus reduced to, and pieced out by common
sense, the wonder vanishes, and we breathe a little freely again. Mr.
Malthus is however, by no means willing to give up his old doctrine,
or <em>eat his own words</em>: he stickles stoutly for it at times. He has
his fits of reason and his fits of extravagance, his yielding and his
obstinate moments, fluctuating between the two, and vibrating backwards
and forwards with a dexterity of self-contradiction which it is
wonderful to behold. The following passage is so curious in this
respect that I cannot help quoting it in this place. Speaking of the
reply of the author of the Political Justice to his former work, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>observes, ‘But Mr. Godwin says, that if he looks into the past
history of the world, he does not see that increasing population has
been controlled and confined by vice and misery <em>alone</em>. <em>In this
observation I cannot agree with him.</em> I will thank Mr. Godwin to
name to me any check, that in past ages has contributed to keep down
the population to the level of the means of subsistence, that does not
fairly come under some form of vice or misery; except indeed the
check of <em>moral restraint, which I have mentioned in the course of this
work</em>; and which to say the truth, whatever hopes we may entertain
of its prevalence in future, has undoubtedly in past ages operated with
very inconsiderable force.’<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> When I assure the reader that I give
him this passage fairly and fully, I think he will be of opinion with
me, that it would be difficult to produce an instance of a more
miserable attempt to reconcile a contradiction by childish evasion, to
insist upon an argument, and give it up in the same breath. Does
Mr. Malthus really think that he has such an absolute right and
authority over this subject of population, that provided he mentions a
principle, or shews that he is not ignorant of it, and cannot be caught
<em>napping</em> by the critics, he is at liberty to say that it has or has not had any
operation, just as he pleases, and that the state of the fact is a matter
of perfect indifference. He contradicts the opinion of Mr. Godwin
that vice and misery are not the only checks to population, and gives
as a proof of his assertion, that he himself truly has mentioned
another check. Thus after flatly denying that moral restraint has any
effect at all, he modestly concludes by saying that it has had some,
no doubt, but promises that it will never have a great deal. Yet in
the very next page, he says, ‘On this sentiment, whether virtue,
prudence or pride, which I have already noticed under the name of
moral restraint, or of the more comprehensive title, the <em>preventive</em>
check, it will appear, that in the sequel of this work, I shall lay
considerable stress,’ p. 385. This kind of reasoning is enough to
give one the head-ache. But to take things in their order.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most singular thing in this singular performance of our author
is, that it should have been originally ushered into the world as the
most complete and only satisfactory answer to the speculations of
Godwin, Condorcet and others, or to what has been called the modern
philosophy. A more complete piece of wrong-headedness, a more
strange perversion of reason could hardly be devised by the wit of
man. Whatever we may think of the doctrine of the progressive
improvement of the human mind, or of a state of society in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>every thing will be subject to the absolute control of reason, however
absurd, unnatural, or impracticable we may conceive such a system to
be, certainly it cannot without the grossest inconsistency be objected
to it, that such a system would necessarily be rendered abortive,
because if reason should ever get this mastery over all our actions,
we shall then be governed entirely by our physical appetites and
passions, without the least regard to consequences. This appears to
me a refinement on absurdity. Several philosophers and speculatists
had supposed that a certain state of society very different from any
that has hitherto existed was in itself practicable; and that if it were
realised, it would be productive of a far greater degree of human
happiness than is compatible with the present institutions of society.
I have nothing to do with either of these points. I will allow to any
one who pleases that all such schemes are ‘false, sophistical, unfounded
in the extreme.’ But I cannot agree with Mr. Malthus that they
would be <em>bad</em>, in proportion as they were <em>good</em>; that their excellence
would be their ruin; or that the true and only unanswerable objection
against all such schemes is that very degree of <em>happiness</em>, virtue and
improvement to which they are supposed to give rise. And I cannot
agree with him in this because it is contrary to common sense, and
leads to the subversion of every principle of moral reasoning. Without
perplexing himself with the subtle arguments of his opponents, Mr.
Malthus comes boldly forward, and says, ‘Gentlemen, I am willing
to make you large concessions, I am ready to allow the practicability
and the desirableness of your schemes, the more happiness, the more
virtue, the more refinement they are productive of the better, all these
will only add to the “exuberant strength of my argument”; I have
a short answer to all objections, to be sure I found it in an old
political receipt-book, called Prospects, &amp;c. by one Wallace, a man
not much known, but no matter for that, <em>finding is keeping</em>, you know’:
and with one smart stroke of his wand, on which are inscribed certain
mystical characters, and algebraic proportions, he levels the fairy
enchantment with the ground. For, says Mr. Malthus, though this
improved state of society were actually realised, it could not possibly
continue, but must soon terminate in a state of things pregnant with
evils far more insupportable than any we at present endure, in consequence
of the excessive population which would follow, and the
impossibility of providing for its support.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is what I do not understand. It is, in other words, to assert
that the doubling the population of a country, for example, after a
certain period, will be attended with the most pernicious effects, by
want, famine, bloodshed, and a state of general violence and confusion,
this will afterwards lead to vices and practices still worse than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>physical evils they are designed to prevent, &amp;c. and yet that at this
period those who will be the most interested in preventing these consequences,
and the best acquainted with the circumstances that lead to
them will neither have the understanding to foresee, nor the heart
to feel, nor the will to prevent the sure evils to which they expose
themselves and others, though this advanced state of population, which
does not admit of any addition without danger is supposed to be the
immediate result of a more general diffusion of the comforts and conveniences
of life, of more enlarged and liberal views, of a more refined
and comprehensive regard to our own permanent interests, as well as
those of others, of corresponding habits and manners, and of a state
of things, in which our gross animal appetites will be subjected to the
practical control of reason. The influence of rational motives, of
refined and long-sighted views of things is supposed to have taken
place of narrow, selfish and merely sensual motives: this is implied in
the very statement of the question. ‘What conjuration and what
mighty magic’ should thus blind our philosophical descendants on
this single subject in which they are more interested than in all the
rest, so that they should stand with their eyes open on the edge of a
precipice, and instead of retreating from it, should throw themselves
down headlong, I cannot comprehend; unless indeed we suppose that
the impulse to propagate the species is so strong and uncontrolable
that reason has no power over it. This is what Mr. Malthus was
at one time strongly disposed to assert, and what he is at present
half inclined to retract. Without this foundation to rest on, the
whole of his reasoning is unintelligible. It seems to me a most
childish way of answering any one, who chooses to assert that mankind
are capable of being governed entirely by their reason, and that
it would be better for them if they were, to say, No, for if they were
governed entirely by it, they would be much less able to attend to its
dictates than they are at present: and the evils, which would thus
follow from the unrestrained increase of population, would be excessive.—Almost
every little Miss, who has had the advantage of a boarding-school
education, or been properly tutored by her mamma, whose hair
is not of an absolute flame-colour, and who has hopes in time, if she
behaves prettily, of getting a good husband, waits patiently year after
year, looks about her, rejects or trifles with half a dozen lovers,
favouring one, laughing at another, chusing among them ‘as one picks
pears, saying, this I like, that I loathe,’ with the greatest indifference,
as if it were no such very pressing affair, and <em>all the while behaves very
prettily</em>; till she is at last smitten with a handsome house, a couple
of footmen in livery, or a black-servant, or a coach with two sleek
geldings, with which she is more taken than with her man:—why,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>what an idea does Mr. Malthus give us of the grave, masculine genius
of our Utopian philosophers, their sublime attainments and gigantic
energy, that they will not be able to manage these matters as decently
and cleverly as the silliest women can do at present! Mr. Malthus
indeed endeavours to soften the absurdity by saying that moral
restraint at present owes its strength to selfish motives: what is this
to the purpose? If Mr. Malthus chooses to say, that men will
always be governed by the same gross mechanical motives that they
are at present, I have no objection to make to it; but it is shifting
the question: it is not arguing against the state of society we are
considering from the consequences to which it would give rise, but
against the possibility of its ever existing. It is absurd to object to a
system on account of the consequences which would follow if we
were to suppose men to be actuated by entirely different motives and
principles from what they are at present, and then to say, that those
consequences would necessarily follow, because men would never be
what we suppose them. It is <em>very</em> idle to alarm the imagination by
deprecating the evils that must follow from the practical adoption of a
particular scheme, yet to allow that we have no reason to dread those
consequences, but because the scheme itself is impracticable.—But I
am ashamed of wasting your reader’s time and my own in thus beating
the air. It is not however my fault that Mr. Malthus has written
nonsense, or that others have admired it. It is not Mr. Malthus’s
nonsense, but the opinion of the world respecting it, that I would be
thought to compliment by this serious refutation of what in itself
neither deserves nor admits of any reasoning upon it. If however we
recollect the source from whence Mr. Malthus borrowed his principle
and the application of it to improvements in political philosophy, we
must allow that he is merely <em>passive</em> in error. The principle itself
would not have been worth a farthing to him without the application,
and accordingly he took them as he found them lying snug together;
and as Trim having converted the old jack-boots into a pair of new
mortars immediately planted them against whichever of my uncle
Toby’s garrisons the allies were then busy in besieging, so the public-spirited
gallantry of our modern engineer directed him to bend the
whole force of his clumsy discovery against that system of philosophy
which was the most talked of at the time, but to which it was the
least applicable of all others. Wallace, I have no doubt, took up his
idea either as a paradox, or a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i>, or because any thing, he
thought, was of weight enough to overturn what had never existed
anywhere but in the imagination, or he was led into a piece of false
logic by an error we are very apt to fall into, of supposing because he
had never been struck himself by the difficulty of population in such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a state of society, that therefore the people themselves would not find
it out, nor make any provision against it. But though I can in some
measure excuse a lively paradox, I do not think the same favour
is to be shewn to the dull, dogged, voluminous repetition of an
absurdity.</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot help thinking that our author has been too much influenced
in his different feelings on this subject, by the particular purpose he
had in view at the time. Mr. Malthus might not improperly have
taken for the motto of his first edition, ‘These three bear record on
earth, vice, misery, and population.’ In his answer to Mr. Godwin,
this principle was represented as an evil, for which no remedy could
be found but in evil;—that its operation was mechanical, unceasing,
necessary; that it went strait forward to its end, unchecked by fear,
or reason, or remorse; that the evils, which it drew after it, could
only be avoided by other evils, by actual vice and misery. Population
was in fact the great devil, the untamed Beelzebub that was only
kept chained down by vice and misery, and that if it were once let
loose from these restraints, it would go forth, and ravage the earth.
That they were therefore the two main props and pillars of society,
and that the lower and weaker they kept this principle, the better
able they were to contend with it: that therefore any diminution of
that degree of them which at present prevails, and is found sufficient
to keep the world in order, was of all things chiefly to be dreaded.—Mr.
Malthus seems fully aware of the importance of the stage-maxim,
To elevate and surprise. Having once heated the imaginations of his
readers, he knows that he can afterwards mould them into whatever
shape he pleases. All this bustle and terror, and stage-effect, and
theatrical-mummery, was only to serve a temporary purpose, for all
of a sudden the scene is shifted, and the storm subsides. Having
frighted away the boldest champions of modern philosophy, this
monstrous appearance, full of strange and inexplicable horrors, is
suffered quietly to shrink back to its natural dimensions, and we find
it to be nothing more than a common-sized tame looking animal,
which however requires a chain and the whip of its keeper to prevent
it from becoming mischievous. Mr. Malthus then steps forward and
says, ‘the evil we were all in danger of was not population,—but
philosophy. Nothing is to be done with the latter by mere reasoning.
I therefore thought it right to make use of a little terror to accomplish
the end. As to the principle of population you need be under no
alarm, only leave it to me and I shall be able to manage it very well.
All its dreadful consequences may be easily prevented by a proper
application of the motives of common prudence and common decency.’
If however any one should be at a loss to know how it is possible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>reconcile such contradictions, I would suggest to Mr. Malthus the
answer which Hamlet makes to his friend Guildenstern, ‘’Tis as
easy as lying: govern these ventiges (the poor-rates and private
charity) with your fingers and thumb, and this same instrument will
discourse most excellent music; look you, here are the stops,’
(namely, Mr. Malthus’s Essay and Mr. Whitbread’s Poor Bill).
To sum up the whole of this argument in one word. Let us suppose
with Mr. Malthus that population can only be kept down by a certain
degree of vice and misery. Let us also suppose that these checks
are for a time removed, and that mankind become perfectly virtuous
and happy. Well, then, according to the former supposition, this
would necessarily lead to an excessive increase of population. Now
the question is, to what degree of excess it would lead, and where it
would naturally stop. Mr. Malthus, to make good his reasoning,
must suppose a miracle to take place; that after population has begun
to increase excessively, no inconvenience is felt from it, that in the
midst of the ‘imminent and immediate’ evils which follow from it,
people continue virtuous and happy and unconscious of the dangers
with which they are surrounded; till of a sudden Mr. Malthus opens
the flood-gates of vice and misery, and they are overwhelmed by
them, all at once. In short he must suppose either that this
extraordinary race of men, in proportion as population increases, are
gradually reduced in size, ‘and less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow
room, throng numberless, like that pygmean race beyond the Indian
mount, or fairy elves’; or that they have some new world assigned
them as a breeding-place, from which attempting to return they are
immediately squeezed to death, like people rushing into a crowded
theatre. On the other hand, I contend that in the natural course of
things, that is, if we suppose people to retain their usual dimensions,
to eat, and drink, and beget children, and bring them up in the usual
way, all this could never happen: for it is impossible but they must
see and feel that there was only room for a certain number. The
moment population became excessive from the <em>excess</em> of virtue and
happiness, its inconveniences would return, and people would no
longer be <em>perfectly virtuous and happy</em>: that is, the old checks of a
certain degree of vice and misery would come into play again, and a
less degree of them (I suppose about as much as we enjoy the
advantage of at present) would be sufficient to deter men from
plunging into greater, would put a stop to the further increase of
population, and anticipate those tremendous evils which Mr. Malthus
apprehends from it, which could never happen unless we suppose
people to have come to a previous, deliberate resolution mutually to
starve one another to death. There is therefore no foundation for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the alarm given by Mr. Malthus, for vice and misery are such ready
and sure resources that we can be at a loss for them at no time; and
farther with respect to the state of society supposed by Mr. Malthus,
that is if we could once drive vice and misery out of the world, I
really do not see what occasion we should have for them afterwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most important question yet remains, which is not how
Mr. Malthus came by his discovery, nor whether he was right in
endeavouring to exemplify it in the first instance by shewing its
effects on an imaginary state of society where it would be naturally
disarmed of its malignity, but whether the practical conclusions he
has drawn from it are not of weight and moment in themselves, and
whether they are not established so clearly and fully as to make it
necessary for us to reverse almost entirely all our old reasonings on
the principles of political economy. I confess, I have some difficulty
in determining, whether Mr. Malthus’s principles do or do not
materially affect the commonly received notions on this subject,
because I really do not know what those principles are, and till
Mr. Malthus himself tells us, whether he would have us believe in
the new revelation or the old, it is impossible that any one should.
If we are to consider those as Mr. Malthus’s real and chastized
opinions which are the least like himself, which most flatly contradict
his former assertions, which being forced from him may be looked
upon as confessions of the truth, I see nothing in these that in any
manner interferes with the common sense of mankind. And though
Mr. Malthus still perseveres in almost all his extreme conclusions,
yet as those conclusions are for the most part unwarrantable assumptions,
disproved even by his own concessions, and shew nothing more
than Mr. Malthus’s qualifications for the delicate office of conscience-keeper
to the rich and great, I am so far from considering them as
new and important discoveries, that I must be excused if I consider
them as in the highest degree false and dangerous, and treat them
accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>LETTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE GENERAL TENDENCY OF POPULATION TO EXCESS</span></h3>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Mr. Malthus’s argument against a state of <em>unlimited</em> improvement,
of perfect wisdom, virtue and happiness, from the vice, misery,
and madness inseparable from such a state would, if admitted, be an
effectual bar to all limited improvement whatever. It is for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>reason, that I have dwelt so long on the subject. If out of timidity,
or complaisance, or prejudice against an unpopular system, we suffer
ourselves to be wheedled into a silly persuasion, that the worst thing
that could happen for the human race would be their being able to
realise not in words only, but in deed all the fine things, that have
been said of them, we then fairly throw ourselves upon the mercy of
our adversaries. For what is there in this case, to hinder Mr.
Malthus, or any one else, from representing every degree of practical
improvement as an approximation to this deplorable crisis, from
binding up the slips and scyons of human happiness with this great
trunk of evil, and root of all our woe, from marking with his slider
and graduated scale all our advances towards this ideal perfection,
however partial or necessary, as so many deviations from the strict
line of our duty, and only sphere of our permanent happiness? It is
evident, that the only danger of all imaginary schemes of improvement
arises from their being <em>exaggerations</em> of the real capacities of our
nature, from supposing that we can pick out all the dross, and leave
nothing but the gold; that is, from their being carried to excess, and
aiming at more than is practicable. But if we allow that improvement
is an evil in the abstract, and that the greater the improvement, the
greater the mischief, that the actual and complete success of all such
schemes would be infinitely worse even than their failure, for that the
most complete and extensive improvement would only prepare the
way for the most deplorable wretchedness, and that the very next
step after reaching the summit of human glory would plunge us into
the lowest abyss of vice and misery,—why truly there will be little
encouragement to set out on a journey that promises so very disagreeable
a conclusion; such a representation of the matter will not
add wings to our zeal for practical reform, but will rather make us
stop short in our career, and refuse to advance one step farther in a
road, that is beset with danger and destruction. People will begin to
look with a jaundiced eye at the most obvious advantages, to resist
every useful regulation, and dread every change for the better. Our
feelings are governed very much by common-place associations, and
are most influenced by that sort of logic which is the shortest.
Thus, ‘that the parts are contained in the whole,’ is a general rule
which is found to hold good in most of the concerns of life; and it is
not therefore easy to drive it out of people’s heads. For this reason,
it will always be difficult to persuade the generality of mankind that a
less degree of improvement is a good thing, though a greater would
be a bad thing, or that the subordinate parts of a system, that would
in reality embody all the ills of life, can be very desirable in themselves.
Mr. Malthus has however by no means left this conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>to the mere mechanical operation of our feelings. He endeavours
formally to establish it. The following passage seems the connecting
link in the chain, which unites the two worlds of theory and practice
together; it cements the argument, gives solidity and roundness to it,
and renders it complete against all improvement, real or imaginary,
present or future, against all absolute perfection or imperfect attempts
at it, and gradual approaches to it. It fairly blocks up the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It cannot but be a matter of astonishment that all writers on the
perfectibility of man, and of society, who have noticed the argument
of an overcharged population, treat it always very slightly, and
invariably represent the difficulties arising from it, as at a great, and
almost immeasurable distance. Even Mr. Wallace, who thought the
argument itself of so much weight as to destroy his whole system of
equality, did not seem to be aware that any difficulty would occur
from this cause, till the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden,
and was incapable of any further increase of produce. Were this
really the case, and were a beautiful system of equality in other
respects practicable, I cannot think that our ardour in the pursuit of
such a scheme ought to be damped by the contemplation of so remote
a difficulty. An event at such a distance might fairly be left to
providence; but the truth is, that if the view of the argument given
in this Essay be just, the difficulty so far from being remote, would
be imminent and immediate. <em>At every period during the progress of
cultivation</em>, from the present moment to the time when the whole
earth was become like a garden, <em>the distress for want of food would be
constantly pressing on all mankind</em>, if they were equal. Though the
produce of the earth <em>might be increasing every year</em>, population <em>would
be increasing much faster</em>; and the redundancy must <em>necessarily</em> be
repressed by the periodical or constant action of vice and misery.’<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to this statement (allowing however that it is a fair
inference from Wallace’s reasoning, and from our author’s own
principle) I would simply ask, whether <em>during this progress of cultivation,
the distress for want of food would be constantly pressing on all
mankind</em> more than it does at present. Let us suppose that men
remain just as vicious, as imprudent, as regardless of their own
interests and those of others as they are at present, let us suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>them to continue just what they are, through all the stages of improved
cultivation to the time when the whole earth was become like
a garden, would this in the smallest degree detract from the benefit?
Would nothing indeed be gained by the earth’s being cultivated like
a garden, that is, by its producing ten times the quantity of food that
it does at present, and being able to maintain ten times the quantity
of inhabitants in the same degree of comfort and happiness that it
does at present, because forsooth they would not at the same time be
ten times better off than they are now? Is it an argument against
adding to the happiness of mankind tenfold, by increasing their
number, their condition remaining the same, that we cannot add to it
a hundred-fold, by increasing their number and improving their condition
proportionably? Or is it any objection to increasing the
means of subsistence by the improved cultivation of the earth, that
the population would keep pace with it? It appears to me that there
must be a particular perversity, some egregious bias in the mind of
any person who can either deny the inference to be drawn from these
questions, or evade it as a matter of indifference, by equivocation and
subterfuge. We might as well assert that because it is most likely
that the inhabitants of the rest of Europe are not better, nor indeed
quite so well off as the people of England, that it would therefore be
no matter if the whole continent of Europe were sunk in the sea, as
if human life was merely to be considered as a sample of what the
thing is, and as if when we have a sample of a certain quality, all the
rest might be very well spared, as of no value. As however I
conceive that Mr. Malthus is not a man to be moved either by
common feelings or familiar illustrations, I shall venture to lay down
one dry maxim on the subject, which he will get over as well as he
can, namely, that an improved cultivation of the earth, and a consequent
increase of food must necessarily lead to one or other of these
two consequences, either that a greater number of people will be
maintained in the same degree of comfort and happiness, other things
being the same, or that means will be afforded for maintaining an
equal number in greater ease, plenty, and affluence. It is plain either
that existence is upon the whole a blessing and that the means of
existence are on that account desirable; that consequently an increased
population is doubly a blessing, and an increase in the means
of existence doubly desirable; or else life is an evil, and whatever
tends to promote it is an evil, and in this case it would be well if all
the inhabitants of the earth were to die of some easy death to-morrow!</p>

<p class='c011'>For my own part, ‘who am no great clerk,’ I cannot by any
efforts, of which I am capable, separate these two propositions, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>it is desirable either that population should have stood still at first, or
that it should go on increasing till the earth is absolutely full; or in
other words, I see no rational alternative between the principle of
extermination (as far as it is in our power) and the principle of the
utmost possible degree of populousness. It is, I conceive, an incontrovertible
axiom, that the proportion between the population and
food being given (and Mr. Malthus tells us that it holds nearly the
same in all the stages of society) the actual increase of population is
to be considered as so much clear gain, as so much got into the purse,
as so much addition to the sum of human happiness. Mr. Malthus
says in another place (second edition, p. 357), ‘The only point in
which I differ from M. Condorcet in this description’ [of the evils
arising from increased population,] ‘is with regard to the period,
when it may be applied to the human race. M. Condorcet thinks
that it cannot possibly be applicable, but at an era extremely distant.
If the proportion between the natural increase of population and food,
which was stated in the beginning of this essay, and which has
received considerable confirmation <em>from the poverty that has been found
to prevail in every stage and department of human society</em>, be in any
degree near the truth, it will appear on the contrary, that the period,
when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence, has long
since arrived, &amp;c.’ Mr. Malthus in different parts of his work makes
a great <em>rout</em> about the distinction between <em>actual</em> and <em>relative</em> population,
and lays it down that an actual increase of population is an advantage,
except when it exceeds the means of subsistence; yet he here seems
to treat the proportion between the increase of population, and food,
which he says has always continued pretty much the same, as the only
thing to be attended to, and to represent the progressive increase of
the actual population, unless we could at the same time banish poverty
entirely from the world, as a matter of the most perfect indifference,
or rather as the most dangerous experiment, that could be tried. Is
not this being wilfully blind to the consequences of his own reasoning?
Oh! but, says Mr. Malthus, you do not state the case fairly. If men
were to continue what they are at present; if there were the same proportionable
quantity of vice, and misery in the world, what you say would
be true. Every thing would then go on as well, or indeed better than
before. But this is impossible, because this increased cultivation, and
a more equal distribution of the produce of the earth could only take
place, in consequence of the increased civilization, virtue, good sense,
and happiness of mankind: and this would necessarily spoil all. For
remove the present quantity of vice and misery existing in the world,
and you remove the only checks, that can keep population down.
‘Though the produce of the earth might be increasing every year,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the population would be increasing much faster; and the redundancy
must be repressed by the old restraints of vice and misery.’ That is
to say, though (according to the second edition) vice, misery, and
moral restraint, operate mutually as checks to population, and though
the diminution of vice and misery could only be the consequence of
the increased strength in the principle of moral restraint, yet this
latter principle would in reality have no effect at all, and in proportion
as the other checks to population, viz. vice and misery, were superseded,
they would become more and more necessary. If there could
be a gradual, and indefinite improvement in the cultivation of the soil,
and every facility could be afforded for the supply of an increasing
population, without supposing some change in the institutions of
society, which would render men better and wiser, than they now
are, Mr. Malthus will perhaps with some reluctance, and uncertainty
hanging over his mind, allow that this would be a considerable
advantage; the population might in this case be kept within some
bounds, and not increase faster than the means of subsistence: but as
this is a change that cannot be looked for without supposing a correspondent
improvement in the morals and characters of men, we must
set off one thing against another, and give up the chance of improvement,
to prevent the shocking alternative connected with it. With
our present modicum of wit and command over our passions, we do
contrive in some measure to make both ends meet, or to cut our coat
according to our cloth, or look before we leap, and are not carried
away, neck or nothing, by this high-mettled courser, Population, over
all the fences and barriers of common sense. But if we were to make
any considerable improvements in horsemanship, or in our <em>knack</em> at
calculation, we should instantly, belying all reasonable expectation,
throw the bridle on the horse’s neck, rush blindly forward in spite
of all obstacles, and freed from the shackles of necessity without
having acquired the discipline of reason, though the one always
instantly resumes its sway, the moment the other ceases, plunge into
all the miseries of famine, without remorse, or apprehension.</p>

<p class='c011'>This I conceive is an express contradiction in terms. Yet I grant
that it is a logical inference from Mr. Malthus’s original statement,
that vice and misery are the only adequate checks to population.
If this were indeed the case, all the consequences that Mr. Malthus
describes, the utmost degree of vice and misery, would necessarily be
the lot of man in all stages and departments of society, whether in
his improved or unimproved state, because in all cases and at all
times his reason would be of no use to him. However great or
however small our attainments in arts or science, or in all other
virtues might be, in this respect we should still be the same; that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>we should be exactly in the condition of the brutes, entirely governed
by an impulse, over which we should have neither check nor control.
Mr. Malthus, however, finding that this account is inconsistent with
the state of human life, and with those checks which certainly do
keep population back from going its natural lengths, now adds moral
restraint as a convenient supplement to his theory, and as our chief
security against vice and misery, though he still insists that where its
effect must be greatest, it would have no effect at all. He gives
up his principle, but retains his conclusion, to which he has no right.
He is like a bad poet who to get rid of a false concord alters the
ending of his first line, and forgets that he has spoiled his rhyme in
the second. On the whole, then, it appears, that at no one period
during the progress of cultivation from the present moment to the
time when it should have reached its utmost limits, would the distress
for want of food be greater than it is at present. In the mean time,
the number of mankind, and consequently their happiness would go
on increasing with the means of their happiness, or subsistence, till
the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden, and was incapable
of any further increase, and we should then be exactly where we are
now with respect to the checks on population. That is, the earth
would maintain ten times its present number of inhabitants in the
same comfort as at present, without our having involved ourselves
in any of those straits and difficulties, those pits and snares, against
which we are so kindly warned by Mr. Malthus. The population,
and the means of subsistence would indeed be stationary, but so they
may be said to be at present. The only difference is that they are
at present unnecessarily stationary from artificial causes, from moral
and political circumstances; in that case the line would be drawn by
nature herself, in other words, by the limited extent of the earth,
and by its limited fertility. <em>This being the case and were a beautiful
system of equality in other respects practicable</em>, (for observe, reader,
I leave the question as <em>to those other respects</em> exactly where I found
it) <em>I cannot think that our ardour in pursuit of such a scheme can in
any wise be damped by the contemplation of the difficulties attendant upon
it from the principle of population.</em> All that could be gained, would
be pure gain without any loss whatever. In short, the principle of
population does not, as I conceive, affect the future improvement of
society in any way whatever, whether on a larger or a smaller scale,
theoretically or practically, generally, or particularly. I have thus,
Sir, endeavoured to answer Mr. Malthus’s argument against the
improved cultivation of the earth, and an increase of population, from
the increased difficulties (as he falsely represents them), that would
all the way press upon society during its progress. He has rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>his paradox in some measure palatable to the reader, by introducing
it as one branch of his answer to Condorcet, and others of the same
school, herein imitating the policy of the house of commons, who
sometimes prevail on the house of lords to pass a bill which they do
not much like, by tacking a money-bill to it. However as the two
subjects are entirely distinct, I beg that they may not be confounded.
The question is simply, whether we are to look upon the progress
of agriculture, civilization, and the populousness which would follow,
(no matter to what extent, nor by whom it is brought about, whether
it is projected by a junto of philosophers, or decided upon in a committee
of the house of commons, enlightened by the genius of Mr.
Malthus and guided by Mr. Whitbread’s wisdom), whether I say,
as a general principle we are to look upon an addition to the inhabitants
of a state, if there is enough to support them, as a good or
an evil. Mr. Malthus has chosen to answer this question under the
head, <em>modern philosophy</em>, so that he is secure of the protection of the
court. I have been willing not to deprive him of this advantage,
and have answered it under the same head. If however any of my
readers should dislike the argument in this connection, they may
easily take it out of the mould in which it is cast, without doing it
the least hurt. To shew how lightly all schemes of improvement
sit on Mr. Malthus’s mind, how easily he thinks they may be puffed
aside with the least breath of sophistry, it will be sufficient to quote
the following passage. After allowing in general that even the best
cultivated countries in Europe might be made to produce double what
they do at present, he says, ‘We should not be too ready to make
inferences against the internal economy of a country from the appearance
of uncultivated heaths without other evidence.’ [It is wonderful
with what slowness and circumspection Mr. Malthus always proceeds
in his disapprobation of any thing, that comes in the prepossessing
garb of an evil. He is only confident and severe in his decisions
against those hidden mischiefs, which lie concealed under a delusive
appearance of good. There is something in the prospect of dearth
and barrenness which is perfectly congenial to the disposition of
Mr. Malthus. He is unwilling to give up a subject which promises
so much scope for his singular talents of bringing good out of evil.]
‘But the fact is, that as no country has ever reached, or probably
will ever reach its highest possible acme of produce, it <em>appears always</em>,
as if the want of industry, or the ill-direction of that industry was
the actual limit to a further increase of produce and population, and
not the absolute refusal of nature to yield any more; but a man who
is locked up in a room, may be fairly said to be confined by the
walls of it, <em>though he may never touch</em> them; and with regard to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>principle of population, it is never the question whether a country
will produce <em>any more</em>, but whether it may be made to produce a
sufficiency to keep pace with an unchecked increase of people.’
This I confess is a singular passage for a practical philosopher to
write. Mr. Malthus here lays it down that the question is not
whether we should do all the good we can, but whether we should
do what we cannot. As to his illustration of a man locked up in
a room, though it is smart and clever, it is not much to the purpose.
The case is really that of a man who has the range of a suite of
rooms and who in a fit of the spleen, or from indolence, or stupidity, or
from any other cause you please, confines himself to one of them, or of
a man who having hired a large commodious apartment, says, I never
make use of the whole of this apartment, I never go within a foot of
the walls, I might as well have it partitioned off, it would be snugger
and warmer, and so still finding that he does not run against his
partition any more than against the wall, should continue, being
determined to have no unnecessary spare-room, to hemm himself in
closer and closer till at last he would be able to stir neither hand
nor foot. That any one, allowing as Mr. Malthus does, that with
proper management and industry this country might be made to
maintain <em>double</em> its present number of inhabitants, or twenty millions
instead of ten, should at the same time affect to represent this as a
mere trifling addition, that practically speaking cannot be taken into
the account, can I think only be explained by supposing in that
person either an extreme callousness of feeling, or which amounts
to pretty much the same thing, a habit of making his opinions
entirely subservient to his convenience, or to any narrow purpose he
may have in view at the moment.—Perhaps if the truth were known,
I am as little sanguine in my expectations of any great improvement
to be made in the condition of human life either by the visions of
philosophy, or by downright, practical, parliamentary projects, as
Mr. Malthus himself can be. But the matter appears to me thus.
It requires some exertion and some freedom of will to keep even
where we are. If we tie up our hands, shut our eyes to the partial
advantages we possess, and cease to exert ourselves in that direction
in which we can do it with the most effect, we shall very soon
‘go deep in the negative series.’ Take away the hope and the
tendency to improvement, and there is nothing left to counteract
the opposite never-failing tendency of human things ‘from bad to
worse.’ There is therefore a serious practical reason against losing
sight of the object, even when we cannot attain it. However, I am
‘free to confess’ (to borrow the language of my betters) that there is
as much selfishness as public spirit in my resistance to Mr. Malthus’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>contradictions. It is a remote question whether the world will ever
be much wiser than it is: but what I am certainly interested in,
is not to submit to have all my ideas confounded by barren sophistry,
nor to give up the little understanding which I may actually
possess. Nor for my own part, were I confined to my room,
should I think myself obliged to any one for blocking up my view
of a pleasant prospect, because I could not move from the place,
where I was.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fundamental principle of Mr. Malthus’s essay is that population
has a constant tendency to become excessive, because it has a tendency
to increase not only in a progressive, but in a geometrical ratio,
whereas the means of subsistence are either positively limited, or at
most can only be made to increase in an arithmetical ratio. But to
be sure of avoiding any thing like misrepresentation in this part of
the argument, where the least error or omission might be fatal to our
author’s whole scheme, let us take his own words.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It may be safely affirmed that population when unchecked goes on
doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical
ratio.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That we may be the better able to compare the increase of
population and food, let us make a supposition, which without pretending
to accuracy, is clearly more favourable to the power of
production in the earth, than any experience that we have had of its
qualities will warrant.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Let us suppose that the yearly additions which might be made
to the former average produce, instead of decreasing, which they
certainly would do, were to remain the same; and that the produce
of this island might be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity
equal to what it at present produces; the most enthusiastic speculator
cannot suppose a greater increase than this. In a few centuries it
would make every acre of land in the island like a garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If this supposition be applied to the whole earth, and if it be
allowed that the subsistence for man which the earth affords, might
be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what it
at present produces; this will be supposing a rate of increase much
greater than we can imagine that any possible exertions of mankind
could make it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It may be fairly pronounced therefore that considering the present
average state of the earth, the means of subsistence, under circumstances
the most favourable to human industry, could not possibly be
made to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The necessary effects of these two different rates of increase,
when brought together, will be very striking. Let us call the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>population of this island eleven millions; and suppose the present
produce equal to the easy support of such a number. In the first
twenty-five years the population would be twenty-two millions, and
the food being also doubled, the means of subsistence would be equal
to this increase. In the next twenty-five years, the population would
be forty-four millions, and the means of subsistence only equal to the
support of thirty-three millions. In the next period, the population
would be eighty-eight millions, and the means of subsistence just
equal to the support of half that number. And at the conclusion of
the first century, the population would be a hundred and seventy-six
millions, and the means of subsistence only equal to the support of
fifty-five millions; leaving a population of a hundred and twenty-one
millions totally unprovided for.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Taking the whole earth instead of this island, emigration would
of course be excluded: and supposing the present population equal
to a thousand millions, the human species would increase as the
numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and subsistence as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9. In two centuries the population would be to the means
of subsistence as 256 to 9; in three centuries as 4096 to 13, and in
two thousand years, the difference would be almost incalculable.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In this supposition no limits whatever are placed to the produce
of the earth. It may increase for ever, and be greater than any
assignable quantity; yet still <em>the power of population being in every
period</em> so much superior, the increase of the human species can only
be kept down to the level of the means of subsistence by the <em>constant
operation of the strong law of necessity</em> acting as a check upon the
greater power;’ or as he elsewhere expresses it ‘<em>by misery or the fear
of misery</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh! my good Sir, spare your calculations. We do not wish to
be informed what would be the exact proportion of the <em>imaginary</em>
means of subsistence to the <em>imaginary</em> population at a period, and at a
rate of increase, at which, if it had been possible for it to have gone
on only half so long as you suppose, the whole race would have been
long ago <em>actually</em> extinct. Mr. Malthus here treats us as the fantastical
landlord treated <em>Sancho Panza</em>, by giving him a magnificent list of a
great variety of delicacies, which it appeared on examination were
not to be had, but made no mention of an excellent dish of cow-heel,
which was the only thing he had in the house, and which exactly
suited the stomach of the squire. I am, like Sancho, disposed to be
satisfied with what I can get; and therefore I must fairly tell
Mr. Malthus that if he will only spare me that first ratio of his, of
a doubled population with respect to this island, or to the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>earth (though there, begging his pardon, if all other things went
right, his arithmetical and geometrical distinction would not as I
have shewn come into play for some time), I say if he will allow,
as far as the principle of population is concerned, that it is possible
to double the number of inhabitants of this country or of the world
without any injury, I shall be perfectly content with this concession:
this first ratio shall be to me the golden number of Pythagoras, and
he may do as he pleases with all the remaining links of an impossible
series, which he has started only, I imagine, as we throw out a tub
to a whale by way of diversion. As to any serious argument, it is
perfectly immaterial, perfectly irrelevant to the question, <em>whether we
should double our population</em>, that we cannot forsooth go on doubling
it for ever; unless indeed it could be shewn that by thus doubling it
once, when we can do it without any inconvenience, we should be
irresistibly impelled to go on doubling it afterwards when it would
have become exceedingly inconvenient, and in fact till the consequence
would be general famine and the most extensive misery. Without
this addition to his argument, either expressed or implied, Mr.
Malthus’s double series is of no use or avail whatever: it looks
very pretty upon paper, and reads very neat, but is of no practical
importance. The evils which it describes so accurately as arising
from the increased disproportion between the ratios at every step are
mere imaginary things, existing no where but in the morbid enthusiasm
of Mr. Malthus’s mind, unless we suppose that every increase of the
existing population, either with or without a proportionable increase
in the means of subsistence, is a vicious habit, a species of phrensy,
where one step only leads to another, till we are plunged into
irretrievable ruin. But I would ask, supposing the inhabitants of
a country to have increased gradually in consequence of an increase
in the means of subsistence, from two millions to four, how that
population of four millions would have a greater tendency to excess,
than the present population of two millions? Would not the same
sense of inconvenience, the same dread of poverty, the same regard
to the comforts of life, operate in the same way and just as much
upon every individual of the four millions, as upon every individual
of the two millions? What then becomes of the increased tendency
to excessive population in consequence of its actual increase? Yet
without this, an increased population is not in itself an evil, or a
good necessarily leading to evil, but a pure and unmixed good
unconnected with any greater evil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even our author’s own account will give us a new country and a
new earth; it will double all the happiness and all the enjoyment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that there is at present in the world. If he had been a man of
sanguine or poetical feelings, methinks this single consideration would
have been enough to have made his heart leap up with a lively joy—to
see ‘fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendant world,’ &amp;c.
but he is a man whom you may call rather of a saturnine than of a
sanguine disposition. He therefore had no leisure to behold this
cheering object, but passes on ‘to nature’s farthest verge,’ till he
enters once more into ‘the confines of Chaos, and the bosom of dim
night.’ Mr. Malthus somewhere speaks familiarly of the association
of ideas, as if he were acquainted with that doctrine. He has here
at any rate very skilfully availed himself of that kind of reasoning,
which owes all its weight to that mechanical principle. In all the
stages of an unchecked population, except the first, it having appeared
that there is a great disproportion between this principle and the
progress of agriculture, our author concludes that his readers will
forget that that, which is so often represented as an evil, can ever be
a good, and therefore peremptorily adds, in defiance of his own
statement, that in <em>every period</em> of the increase, the power of population
is much superior to the other. Though it appears to me then that
Mr. Malthus by his ratios has gained nothing in point of argument
over his readers, he has gained much upon their imagination. By
representing population so often as an evil, and by magnifying its
increase in certain cases as so enormous an evil, he raises a general
prejudice against it. Whenever you talk of any improvement or
any increase of population consequent upon it, he immediately plays
off his infinite series against you. He makes the transition from a
practicable to an impracticable increase of population, from that
degree of it, which is desirable to that which is excessive, by the
assistance of his mathematical scale, as easily as you pass from the
low notes of a harpsichord to the high ones. There seems no
division between them. It is true that so long as we confine ourselves
to the real question before us and distinguish between what is
practicable, and what can never possibly happen, the evil consequences
of the system we contend for are merely chimerical. But as
Hercules in order to strangle the earth-born Antæus was obliged to
lift him from the ground, Mr. Malthus, in order to complete his
triumph over common sense, is obliged to call to his aid certain airy
speculations and fanciful theories of dangers, that, by his own confession,
can never possibly exist. Whenever you are for setting out
on the road of reform, Mr. Malthus stops you on the threshold, and
says, Do you consider where you are going? Don’t you know
where this road will lead you? and then, with a ‘come on, sir,
here’s the place: look how fearful and dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>so low’; he hurries you forward to his imaginary precipice, and
shews you the danger you have so narrowly escaped. However, it
is not Mr. Malthus’s rhetoric, but our own wilful blindness, that
must persuade us that we have escaped being dashed to pieces down
any precipices, when he himself tells us that the road is nothing more
than a long winding declivity.</p>

<p class='c011'>I conceive there were two very capital errors in Mr. Malthus’s
first essay, which though he has abandoned or in a great measure
softened them down in his subsequent edition, still adhere to all his
reasonings, and give them a wrong bias. The first of these was,
that vice and misery are the only checks to population: secondly,
that if population were for any time freed from these restraints, it
would in that case go on increasing with a force and rapidity, which
nothing would be able to withstand, and which would bear down the
feeble mounds that had before opposed its progress till the whole
would end in one wide scene of universal uproar and confusion. As
if, in the first place, mere misery of itself, without a sense of greater
misery, and a desire to avoid it, would do any thing to prevent
population; and in the second place, as if though the tax of vice
and misery were taken off for a time, yet the recurrence of the same
evils afterwards would not operate in the same way to repress population,
or as if population would in the mean time have acquired any
preternatural strength, with which its counteracting causes would be
unable to contend, or as if the mere mechanical checks to population
from the actual evils attendant upon it were not always necessarily a
match for, and proportioned to, the strength of the principle itself,
and its immediate tendency to excess. It is astonishing to see how
those men, who pique themselves the most on the solidity of their
understandings, and on a kind of dull matter-of-fact plodding accuracy,
are perpetually led away by their imaginations: the more so because
they are the dupes of their own vanity, and never suspect that they
are liable to any such deception. In the present instance our author
has been hurried into an unfounded assumption by having his imagination
heated with a <em>personification</em>. He has given to the principle of
population a personal existence, conceiving of it as a sort of infant
Hercules, as one of that terrific giant brood, which you can only
master by strangling it in its cradle; forgetting that the antagonist
principle which he has made its direct counterpoise, still grows with
its growth and strengthens with its strength, being in fact its own
offspring: and that the sharper evils which excessive population
brings along with it, more severe in proportion to its excess, naturally
tend to repress and keep population down to the same level, other
circumstances being supposed the same. Nothing can be clearer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>my understanding than this; yet it is upon the misrepresentation or
misconception of this principle that most of Mr. Malthus’s sophisms
and ambiguities hinge.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is necessary to make a distinction between the tendency in
population to increase, and its power to increase; otherwise we may
fall into great errors. The power of population to increase is an
abstract thing independent of circumstances, and which is therefore
always the same. Its effects may therefore be very well described
by a mathematical series. When we speak of the power of population
to increase in a certain continued ratio, we do not mean to say
that it will or will not do so, but merely that it is possible that it should
do so from the nature of the principle itself. The power of population
to increase is in fact the same both before and after it has become
excessive. But I conceive this is not the case with its <em>tendency</em> to
increase, unless we mean its <em>unchecked tendency</em>, which is saying
nothing; for if we speak of its real tendency to increase, this certainly
is not always the same, but depends exceedingly on circumstances,
that is, is greater or less in proportion as the population is or is
not excessive. The ratio in which Mr. Malthus has represented
population as having a natural tendency to increase, can therefore
only relate to its unchecked progress, or to its increase while the
means of subsistence can be made to keep pace with it; inasmuch as
it has an actual tendency to increase in this ratio, only while it is free
from checks; but the moment these checks begin to operate it is
necessarily limited by them, or kept down within a certain point to
the level of the means of subsistence. In short, as a practical guide,
Mr. Malthus’s table is extremely fallacious; for the population has
a tendency to go on as 1, 2, 4, 8, &amp;c. only while the subsistence
answers to it, or is as 1, 2, 4, 8, &amp;c. and when the means of subsistence
can only be made to increase as 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. then the
population will, in the natural course of things, come down to it and
increase only as 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. or supposing it to have generally a
certain tendency to excess, it will then increase as 1¼, 2½, 3¾, 5, &amp;c.
The actual, positive, practical tendency in population <em>to increase</em> is
not therefore always the same, and for that very reason its tendency
<em>to excess</em> is always the same, neither greater nor less, in consequence
of the absolute increase in population. Mr. Malthus himself admits
fully the distinction between the actual increase of population and its
excessive increase, between the tendency of population to increase
with the means of subsistence and its tendency to increase beyond
those means. In fact, almost one half of his voluminous work is
taken up by extensive historical researches to prove that the population
is in all ages and countries, in every form of society, and stage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>civilization kept down <em>nearly</em> to the means of subsistence: that
population has not therefore at one time more than another, when it
is strong than when it is weak, in an improved than in a neglected
state of cultivation, a tendency to rush on beyond its necessary
limits: yet if there is any one inference to be drawn from the general
spirit and tenor of Mr. Malthus’s reasonings, it is this, that we ought
not to encourage population, nor be anxious about the increase of the
means of subsistence, but ought rather to keep them back as much as
possible, because every addition made to population by whatever
means or in whatever circumstances, has a direct and unavoidable
tendency to make it go on increasing with an accelerated force; or
that the positive benefit of an enlarged population is always counterbalanced
by the increased danger of the excess to which it naturally
leads. Mr. Malthus by setting a certain degree of plenty against a
certain degree of excessive population, has made it appear as if the
two things were inseparably connected, as if supposing a certain
progress made in the one ratio you may then by passing over to the
opposite line see immediately what progress had been made at the
same time in the other, that is, what quantity of actual and excessive
population, proportioned to the increase in the means of subsistence
and its immediate consequence, would require to be cut off by
forcible and unnatural means, by vice and misery. It therefore
looks very much as if plenty were the immediate fore-runner of
famine, as if by sowing the seeds of virtue and happiness you were
ensuring a larger harvest of vice and misery, the evil engrafted on
any good being always greater than the real benefit itself, and as if
by advancing population and increasing the means of its support,
you were only opening a new Iliad of woes, and giving larger
scope to the baneful operation of this principle. So that it is not the
increase of good that we are to think of, but the introduction of
evil that we are to guard against. The proportion by which we are
to be guided is clear and demonstrable; it is as 256 to 9, and so
regularly through all the gradations upwards and downwards. At
this rate it is pretty clear that our only object must be to confine
human happiness within as narrow limits, and to keep the population
down as low as possible, at least to suffer no addition to it. We
are something in the condition of a man suspended on a balance
with sharp-pointed spikes placed close to his body, and who must
not stir for his life. Now the source of this fallacy (on which
the whole turns, for without it it is null and abortive) lies here,
namely in supposing that of the two ratios here connected together,
the one is the cause of, or has any thing to do with the other. For
the ratio in the upper line being at number 256 does not depend on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the other ratio being at number 9, but simply on its being so many
removes from the root or first number. It only expresses a possible
or imaginary series, or the independent, direct, physical power of
increase, or abstract tendency to increase in population at each step,
and what that increase would amount to in a given number of steps,
being left entirely to itself. If it expresses any thing else, or the
actual increase of population combined with and in reference to the
means of subsistence, it is utterly false and delusive, and a contradiction
in terms. For population as regulated by, and arising
out of the means of subsistence cannot have got the start of it in so
prodigious a manner, and as unconnected with the increase of the
latter cannot depend upon it. In the one case, population instead
of being to the means of subsistence as 256 to 9, will only be a
little a-head of it, or as 9½ to 9: in the other case it will be as
256, whether the food has in a given time increased from 1 to 9,
or only from 1 to 6, or whether it has stood still at 1. The
number of inhabitants from the beginning of the world, proceeding
by the geometrical ratio, would have been going on just the same
whether they had ever had any thing to eat or not (they are a kind
of enchanted people who live without food) whether the quantity of
food had been more or less, whether there has been any improvements
in agriculture or not. Though the improvements in agriculture
had stood still at 1 in the arithmetical scale this would not lessen or alter
the height to which the geometrical scale would have mounted in
the interval. ‘It keeps on its way unslacked of motion.’ By
advancing in the arithmetical scale or increasing the means of
subsistence, you do not advance the geometrical scale, much less by
increasing the disproportion between the two, do you increase the
<em>waste</em> population of the world, which must be greater in proportion
as less of it had been provided for. On the other hand, you necessarily
lessen this disproportion. For instead of supposing that if we
had remained at 1 in the lower scale, we should then have been at
1 in the upper, or that if we had advanced no further than 3, the
disproportion would then only have been 4 to 3, and so on, whereas
by going on it is now as 256 to 9, the fact is that the disproportion
instead of being as 256 to 9, would have been 256 to 1, or 2, or 3:
and that the further we go in the one scale, though we cannot keep
up with, or overtake the other, yet we lose so much the less ground
and are nearer it than we should otherwise be. To argue otherwise
is to be like the children who when they cannot keep up with others,
stand still and begin to cry, thinking this the likeliest way to make
them slacken their pace. I shall therefore beg leave to look upon
every increase in the means of subsistence or actual population, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>so much gained upon the <em>infinite series</em>: by keeping back the <em>actual</em>
means of subsistence, I do not lessen the <em>possible</em> or abstract tendency
of population to increase, and I only add to its actual tendency to
increase in proportion as I add to its actual means of support. We
have therefore a clear addition to its actual quantity without any
addition to its tendency to excess, or without strengthening the
evil principle, the germ of incalculable mischief, which population
contains within it. Mr. Malthus has taken no pains to guard his
readers against the conclusion, that by increasing the actual population,
you increase its actual tendency to increase, as if either the
disposition to propagate the species were stronger in proportion to
the number of those who possess it, or as if in proportion as the
power is spread over a larger surface, it were not counteracted by
being accompanied in each individual with a proportionable share
of common sense and reason, so that he will not be a bit more likely
to run upon famine because there will be twice as many to keep
him company as there used to be. The tendency to excessive
population in any community does not depend upon the number of
individuals in it, who have the power of abusing their liberty, or on
the quantity of mischief they <em>might</em> do, but upon the moral character
of the individuals composing it, upon the difference between the
strength of moral restraint and the strength of physical appetite, or
on the actual inconvenience to which they <em>will</em> submit for the sake
of gratifying their passions. In short the tendency to excess does
not depend on the point in the scale where the <em>limit</em> is drawn, but
upon the tendency to overleap that limit; now this tendency or
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">impetus</span></i> is not increased by the distance which it has gone, like a
stone rolling down a hill, or like a torrent of water accumulating, but
is like a cart or waggon left on a declivity with a drag-chain fastened
to one of the wheels, which is carried forward till the chain is pulled
tight and then it stops of itself. This is a very clumsy comparison,
but it has some resemblance to the thing. We are not to calculate
the actual tendency to excess in population by the excess of the
power itself over the means of subsistence, which is greater as we
advance, but by the excess of the power restrained by other motives
and principles over the means of subsistence. In algebraic language
the tendency to excess is not equal to the power of population simply, but
to the power, <em>minus</em> the difficulty of providing for its support, or the
influence which that difficulty has on the conduct of rational beings.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we suppose a barren island with half a dozen savages upon it,
living upon roots, vermin, and crawfish, without any of the arts or
any of the conveniences of life, ignorant of agriculture, neither
knowing nor caring how to improve their condition, passing their time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in stupid indolence, with as little pretensions to reason or refinement
as can well be desired, in short a very unphilosophical, improgressive,
viscious, miserable set of barbarians as need be; now what difference
would it make in the condition of these poor uninformed wretches,
or how would it add to their vices, their ignorance, or ‘squalid
poverty,’ if we suppose another island at a few leagues distance,
of about the same circumference, maintaining nearly the same
number of inhabitants living in the same manner? Yet as it is
probable that these poor lousy wretches<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> leading a life of sloth
and hunger, may upon the whole have more enjoyment than misery
(for even the life of a savage seems better than no life at all, nay
some have gone so far as to say that it was better than any other
life) it would be desirable that there should be such another island so
inhabited. But it is exactly the same thing whether we suppose
twice the number of people inhabiting twice the extent of ground, or
maintained on the same ground, being twice as much cultivated;
population would not press the more on the means of subsistence, nor
would the misery be greater, nor the checks required to prevent it
greater. That is to say, an advance made in the state of cultivation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and in the arts of life so as to maintain double the population must
always be the means of doubling the numbers and enjoyment of any
people. The only possible difference would be that as this
increased population would be the consequence of greater industry
and knowledge, it would, one should think, denote of itself, that the
people would be less liable to unforeseen accidents, and less likely to
involve themselves in wilful distress than before. This is the first
step in the progress of civilization and in the history of all nations.
From this description of a barren island supporting a few wandering
half-starved ignorant savages, such as England might have been once,
let us turn our eyes to what England is now;—populous, enlightened,
free, rich, powerful and happy; excelling equally in arts, and arms,
the delight and terror of the rest of the world; the abode of science,
the nurse of virtue, the darling seat of the muses; boasting her long
line of heroes, and sages; her Bacon, her Newton, her Shakespear,
her Milton, and her Locke;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> blest with the most perfect government
administered in the most perfect manner; having a king, lords, and
commons, each balancing the other, and each in their several station
and degree being security for every kind of liberty and every kind of
property, harmoniously conspiring together for the good of the whole,
taking care first of their own rights and interests as the most important,
and then of those of others: subject to mild and equal laws, which
afford the same immediate protection to every one in the enjoyment
of his liberty and his property, whether that property is five thousand
a year or no more than a shilling a day: maintaining in different
degrees of comfort, and affluence, from the common necessaries to the
highest luxuries of life, ten millions of souls, all supported by their
own labour and industry or that of others; all plying close with
cheerful and patient activity to some ingenious and useful handicraft,
or some more severe but necessary labour, or else reclining in ease
and elegance, and basking in the sunshine of life; her meanest beggar
owing the rags which cover his nakedness, and the crust of bread
which keeps his body and soul together to some of the most useful
inventions which support, and to that humanity which is only to be
found in civilized society. Shall we forget her schools, her colleges,
her hospitals, her churches, her crowded cities, her streets lined with
shops, enriched with the produce and manufactures of her own soil, or
glittering with the spoils of a hundred nations, her thronged assemblies,
her theatres, her balls, her operas, her ‘palaces, her ladies and her
pomp’; her villas, her parks, her cottages, her hamlets, her rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>cultivated lands, teeming with plenty, her green valleys, her ‘upland
swells, echoing to the bleat of flocks,’ her brave contented peasantry,
their simple manners and honest integrity; and shall we wish to
degrade this queen of nations, this mistress of the world once more
into a horde of fierce barbarians, treading back our steps, and resigning
this splendid profusion of all that can adorn and gladden human
life, this gay variety, this happy union of all that is useful and all that
is ornamental, the refinements of taste and decorations of fashion, the
beautiful distinctions of artificial society, and the solid advantages
derived from our constitution in church and state, for the groveling
dispositions, the brutal ignorance, the disgusting poverty, the dried
skins and miserable huts of the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, or
New Holland? Yet this it seems from the doctrine of Mr. Malthus
is our only safe policy, since the lower we are in the scale of
existence, the fewer and more miserable we are, the farther removed
we must be from the tremendous evils of excessive population, which
are the necessary consequences of the progress of refinement and
civilization. But as the fact <em>so far</em> does not, as I suppose Mr.
Malthus will himself allow, square with his theory, (for at no time
during the progress of cultivation does the population appear to have
been pressing with increased force on the means of subsistence, so
that though the produce of the earth was increasing every year, the
inhabitants were increasing much faster, every addition to the actual
produce only occasioning some new addition to the swoln and bloated
state of population, and aggravating the already dreadful symptoms of
the disease) as I say the progress of cultivation and improvement of
different kinds has not produced any of those fatal consequences we
might be led to expect from it, so neither do I apprehend any of
these fatal consequences in future from carrying it as much farther as
it can go. I should just reverse the reasoning of Mr. Malthus, who
taking the evil as at its greatest height when the world is supposed to
be completely full and completely enlightened, thence argues downwards
against all attempts at improvement as dangerous innovations;
so I, finding that an improved cultivation and enlarged population are
good things through the inferior gradations, am apt to think they
would continue so, proceeding upwards to the topmost round of the
ladder, as far as population is concerned, for I once more give full
and fair warning that I engage in this question no farther, any loose,
general or accidental expressions to the contrary notwithstanding.
To make good Mr. Malthus’s argument against population, we must
suppose, as I have said before, that the tendency in population to
increase goes on increasing with the thing itself: this would be true,
if as our author supposes in his first edition, the passion always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>required the same vent, in all circumstances, that is if we suppose
man to be a mere headstrong animal in this respect, his reason having
no influence whatever over his conduct, or which amounts to the same
thing, that <em>actual</em> vice and misery (not foreseen, but felt) are the only
checks to population. At this rate, it is evident that the degree of
misery attending the gratification of the passion would have no effect
to restrain it, all degrees being alike indifferent or that the quantity
of actual misery incurred would be in proportion to the increased
power of producing it. I shall examine these positions more at large
in another letter; I here wish to shew in a few words that as applied
to the subject of increasing population, they lead to a direct absurdity.
If we suppose this passion to be perfectly blind and insensible, to be
deaf to all remonstrance, and regardless of all consequences, then no
matter in what depths of misery it involves us, it will have its way,
and go its own lengths. Take away the preventive check of <em>moral
restraint</em> (which only comes in as a snivelling interpolation in some
places of the second edition) and the population would no doubt go
on doubling as fast as it could, not as fast as the means of subsistence
would let it; that is, the excess of population would be great in
proportion to the actual previous increase, or the excessive multiplication
of the species would be the necessary consequence of, and
commensurate with the power of excessive multiplication, which
would depend on the number of persons having that power. Now
this is contrary to all we know of facts and human nature, since
in this case there could be no restraint to population at any time,
but the extreme of vice or the extreme of misery. The power of
population to increase is (we will grant) unlimited, but the tendency
to increase is necessarily limited by its tendency to excess
and limited by it in proportion to the excess. That is to say, it
does not follow that though when there ought to be only two millions
of inhabitants, there may be four, owing to the weakness of the above-mentioned
principle of <em>moral restraint</em>, that therefore that four (by the
tendency of population to increase in a geometrical ratio or to double
itself,) will in like manner become eight, and so on, namely because
the checks to it will increase in proportion; or though the prospect of
the inconveniences arising from doubling the population in the first
instance, the quantity of food remaining the same, might not be
sufficient to deter people, or overcome this propensity, yet the
prospect of famine consequent upon the second doubling undoubtedly
would, because their regard to consequences is supposed to remain the
same, and the evils they have to dread in the one case are greater,
and unless we suppose them to have become more stupid and brutal,
must operate upon them more forcibly than in the other. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>strength of the passion itself may be considered as always the same,
or a given quantity: but the motives to resist it arising from the
consequences of its indulgence are not always the same, but may be
either none at all, or very slight, or considerable, or extreme, as the
obstacles to its indulgence may be either none at all, of a trifling
inconvenience, or poverty, or absolute famine. Now the degree of
excess in population, or the inconveniences to which we expose
ourselves by inconsiderate gratification will depend entirely on the
difference, be it more or less, between the strength of the passion in
each individual, and the strength of moral restraint. If the latter
principle is weak, it will require to be stimulated by the immediate
apprehension of some very great inconvenience, before it will become
a match for the importunity of physical desire. If it is strong, a
general conviction of the propriety or prudence of self-denial will be
sufficient to incline the balance. But in no case unless we suppose
man to be degraded to the condition of the brutes, will this principle
be so low and weak as to have no effect at all, so that no apprehension
of the last degree of wretchedness, as the consequence, would take off
or abate the edge of appetite. There is therefore always a point at
which the excess ceases, and we have seen what this point at all
times is. Thus if the operation of rational motives is so much upon
a level with the physical impulse, as to keep population exactly or
nearly down to the means of subsistence, it will do so equally whether
that population is actually greater or less, whether it is stationary or
progressive, for it will increase only with the means by which it is
supported. On the other hand if from the manners, the habits, and
institutions of society, there is a considerable tendency in population
to excess, this tendency to excess will not be greater or less in
proportion to the actual number of inhabitants, or the actual quantity
of food, nor will it depend on their being progressive or stationary,
but on the morals of the people being retrograde, progressive, or
stationary; for the tendency of population itself to excess or to
<em>increase</em> excessively (a dubious kind of expression) is not a perpetual,
indefinite, invariable tendency to increase from 2 to 4, from 4 to 8,
&amp;c. (as I have just shewn) but a tendency to increase <em>beyond</em> the
means of subsistence to a certain point or degree. This tendency to
excess will consequently be the same wherever we fix the point of
subsistence, because it is only a given tendency to outstrip that limit
whether nearer or farther off, whether advancing or retreating.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> It
is true there is a tendency in population in this case to increase <em>faster</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>than the means of subsistence, but not to increase <em>faster and faster</em>, or
to get more and more a-head of it. It is in fact only a disproportionate
superiority in certain motives over others, which subjects the community
or certain classes of it to a great degree of want and hardship:
and as far as their imprudence and folly will carry them, they will go,
but they will not go farther. They will submit to be <em>pinched</em>, but not
to be <em>starved</em>, unless this consequence may sometimes be supposed to
follow from the partial and unnatural debasement of certain classes of
the community, by driving them to despair and rendering them callous
to suffering. But the general tendency in population to become
excessive can only be increased by the increased relaxation of moral
restraint, or by gradually weakening the motives of prudence, reason,
&amp;c. I cannot make this matter plainer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus has not I conceive given this question of increasing
population and practical improvement fair play. He has contrived to
cover over its real face and genuine features with the terrible mask of
modern philosophy. His readers having been prevailed upon to give
up the fee-simple of their understandings into his hands, that no undue
advantages might be taken of them by the <em>perfectibility</em> school, they
find it difficult to get it back out of his hands, though they want it to
go on again (the alarm being over) in the old road of common sense,
practical improvement, and liberal discussion. He had persuaded
himself that population was such an enormous evil in connection with
a scheme of unlimited improvement, that he can hardly reconcile himself
to it, or tell whether to think it a good or an evil in any shape,
or according to any scheme. By indulging his prejudices, he has so
confounded his perceptions, that he cannot judge rightly, even when
he wishes to do it. He found it most convenient, when he had to
confute Mr. Godwin, to describe reason as a principle of no practical
value whatever, as a mere negation. As therefore by the removal of
vice and misery the office of checking population would devolve upon
this principle, which could do nothing, population would in fact have
no check left to it, and then certainly the most terrible consequences
would ensue. The only question would be, how soon we should
begin cutting one another’s throats, or how many (whether a greater
or a smaller number) had better be employed on this kind of work.
We perceive very plainly that this must be the inevitable consequence
of increased population, if it can only be kept down by the positive
checks of vice and misery. We apply the theory very clearly to
a future stage of the progress; but though, if the theory were true,
exactly the same scenes ought to be acting before our eyes at present
on a smaller scale, yet as we find that this is not the case, we leave
this circumstance out of the question, and conclude that there must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>be some secret difference, some occult cause, something we cannot
very well explain, which makes the present state of things preferable
to all others: at least whatever might be the consequences of population,
if certain alterations and improvements were to take place, we
are sure that it produces no such consequences at present. With
respect to the lower, or actual stages of population and improvement,
Mr. Malthus supposes the <em>preventive</em> checks to operate as well as the
<em>positive</em>, the fear of misery as well as the misery itself, because we
know that it does: but whenever you suppose any alteration or improvement
to take place in the world, so that you have not the fact to
confront him with, he immediately assumes the positive checks, or
actual vice and misery, as the only checks to population; herein
trusting to his theory. Whenever you are found to be advancing in
the scale (which must be indeed from some of the restraints being
taken off) he directly supposes that you are to be set free from all
restraints whatever. He lets loose his ratios upon you, and away
they go like a clock running down. This indeed would not be so
well. Mr. Malthus thus artfully makes the question of progressive
improvement to be, whether we are to be governed as now by mixed
motives, or to be released from all moral restraint, for he supposes
that if population once passes a certain bourne, which he points out
to you, it will then become perfectly untractable, all its future excesses
will be prevented only by actual vice and misery. Thus though all
the good of our present situation, all wherein it differs from a state
of brutal violence or lingering want, is in fact owing to the prevalence
of a less degree of reason and foresight, yet that if that principle were
strengthened, and the consequence were an increase of population,
and a more general diffusion of the comforts of life, this principle
would then be of no avail in preventing or correcting the excesses to
which the unrestrained indulgence of our appetites would give rise.
There is a degree of absurdity, which staggers belief and almost
challenges our conviction, by making it incredible that if we ourselves
do not labour under some strong deception, the human understanding
should be capable of such extreme folly.</p>

<p class='c011'>I shall conclude this letter by laying down two or three general
maxims, which appear to me to follow clearly from the view which
has been here taken of the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, while population goes on increasing at that tremendous rate
described by Mr. Malthus, it shews that there is nothing to restrain
it; that there is no need of any thing to restrain it: that it is wanted,
that its increase is a thing to be desired, not to be dreaded, and that
if it were possible for it to increase ten times faster, it would be so
much the better.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Secondly, when it arrives at a certain point, that is, where the
population begins to press on the means of subsistence, either from
natural or artificial causes, or when it threatens to become an evil
from excess, it naturally stops short of its own accord, the checks to
it from vice, misery and moral restraint taken all together becoming
stronger as the excess becomes greater. It therefore produces its
own antidote and produces it in quantities exactly in proportion to
its own extent. It is not therefore (as Mr. Malthus would, when
he pleases, have us believe) like a stone hanging suspended over a
precipice, which if it once loses its balance will be hurled furiously
down, rolling and bounding from steep to steep with increased velocity
till it reaches the bottom, but like a balance suspended by a check-weight,
where you cannot increase the pressure on one side without
increasing the resistance proportionably on the other. It may therefore
at worst be left very safely to itself, instead of being considered as
an evil against whose unforeseen ravages no precautions are sufficient.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly, as the same quantity of vice and misery co-operating with
the same degree of moral restraint, will always keep population at the
same (relative) point, so a less degree of actual vice and misery
operating on a greater degree of moral restraint, that is, of reason,
prudence, virtue, &amp;c. will produce the same effect: and we may
always judge of the happiness of a people, and of the beneficial effects
of population by the prevalence of moral restraint over vice and
misery, instead of supposing that vice and misery are the best pledges
of the happiness of a state, and the only possible security against
excessive population. Consequently, the object of the philosopher
must be to increase the influence of rational motives, and lessen the
actual operation of vice and misery. It is only in proportion as he
does this, that he does any thing; for not only are vice and misery
such cheap commodities that they may be had at any corner merely
with asking for (any bungler may contract for them in the gross) but
farther though they undoubtedly operate as checks to population, I
must be excused from admitting that they <em>remedy</em> the evils of population,
unless the disease can be considered as its own remedy, for in
the degree in which they generally exist, they are the only evils, that
are ever likely to rise from it, and as to those imaginary, unknown
and unheard of evils, with which Mr. Malthus is perpetually threatening
us in order to reconcile us to those we bear, I deny the possibility
of their existence upon any known principles of human society, either
in its improved, or unimproved state.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not mean to say that there is any thing in the general
principles here stated that Mr. Malthus is at present disposed to
deny, or that he has not himself expressly insisted on in some part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>or other of his <em>various</em> work; it is enough for my purpose that there
are other parts of his work in which he has contradicted them and
himself, and that the uniform tenor of his first work leans directly
the opposite way; and it is not my business so much to inquire, how
much Mr. Malthus retains of his old philosophy, as how many of
their old feelings his readers retain on the subject, on which he will
be able to build as many false conclusions as he pleases, and with
more safety to himself, than if he still persevered in the direct and
unqualified assertion of exploded error. Plain, downright consistent
falsehood is not dangerous: it is only that spurious mixture of truth
and falsehood, that perpetual oscillation between the two extremes,
that wavering and uncertainty that baffles detection by rendering it
difficult to know on what ground you are to meet your adversary,
that makes the sophist so formidable as he is. In order therefore
that Mr. Malthus may not avail himself of his inconsistencies, I shall
assume a right to contradict him as often as he contradicts himself,
and to consider the peculiar doctrines of his work as its essential and
only important doctrines.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>LETTER V<br /> <span class='large'>WHETHER VICE AND MISERY ARE THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES OF, AND THE ONLY CHECKS TO, THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULATION</span></h3>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>—I have in my last letter taken more pains than, I believe, was
necessary to shew that the tendency of population to increase is not a
<em>dangerous</em> one; or at any rate that the actual increase of population
does not increase the danger. The same proportionable quantity of
vice and misery would always be <em>sufficient</em> to keep down the excess of
population beyond the means of subsistence, whether we suppose those
means to be great or small: there is another question, whether the same
quantity of vice and misery is always <em>necessary</em> for this purpose; and
further, whether all the vice and misery in the world are not only
necessary checks to, but the immediate effects of, the principle of
population, and of nothing else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before I proceed, I must stop to observe that I have just been
perusing the corrections, additions, &amp;c. to the third and <em>last</em> edition
of the Essay; and I confess I have not much heart to go on. The
pen falls from my hand. For to what purpose is it to answer a man,
who has answered himself, who has hardly advanced an opinion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>he has not retracted, who after all your pains to overturn the extravagant
assertions he had brought forward, comes and tells you,
Why I have given them up myself; so that you hardly know whether
to look upon him in the light of an adversary or an ally. I do not
like this shadow-fighting, any more than Sancho liked his master’s
fighting with enchanters. When Don Quixote had to encounter the
knight of the Prodigious Nose, his valour was inflamed, and he rushed
fiercely on his antagonist, but when after having unhorsed him, he
found that it was his old friend and neighbour the Batchelor Carrasco,
the fury of his arm was suspended, and he knew not what to say or
do.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Till Mr. Malthus lays aside his harlequin’s coat and sword,
and ceases to chase opinions through a rapid succession of varying
editions, it is not an easy matter to come up with him or give him
fair battle. It was thought a work of no small labour and ingenuity
to make a harmony of the Evangelists. I would recommend it to
some one (who thinks himself equal to the task) to make a harmony
of Mr. Malthus’s different performances. Till this is done, it seems
impossible to collect the sense of his writings, and consequently to
answer them. It should not therefore be the object of any one who
would set himself to answer Mr. Malthus, so much to say that such
and such are the real and settled opinions of that author, as that
such opinions are floating in different parts of his writings, that they
are floating or fixed in the minds of his readers, and that those
opinions are not so correct as they might be. If Mr. Malthus had
chosen to disclaim certain opinions with their consequences, advanced
in the first edition, instead of denying that he ever held such opinions,
though he may still be detected with the <em>manner</em>, he would have saved
me the trouble of writing, and himself the disagreeable task of reading,
this <em>rude</em> attack upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus lays down as the basis of all his reasonings the two
following positions, viz. ‘First, that food is necessary to the existence
of man.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary, and
will remain nearly in its present state.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘These two laws,’ he adds, ‘ever since we have had any knowledge
of mankind, appear to have been fixed laws of our nature; and as we
have not hitherto seen any alteration in them, we have no right to
conclude that they will ever cease to be what they are now, without
an immediate act of power in that Being who first arranged the
system of the universe. The best arguments for the perfectibility of
man are drawn from a contemplation of the great progress that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>has already made from the savage state, and the difficulty of saying
where he is to stop. But towards the extinction of the passion
between the sexes, no progress whatever has hitherto been made.
It appears to exist in as much force at present as it did two thousand,
or four thousand years ago. There are individual exceptions now
as there always have been. But, as these exceptions do not appear
to increase in number, it would surely be a very unphilosophical
mode of arguing to infer merely from the existence of an exception,
that the exception would in time become the rule, and the rule the
exception.’</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the first position here laid down that food is necessary to
the existence of man, I shall not certainly dispute it. As to the
second kind of necessity, the gratification of the passion between the
sexes, I must beg leave to deny that this necessity is ‘like unto
the first’ or to be compared with it. Does Mr. Malthus really mean
to say that a man can no more abstain from the commerce of women,
than he can live without food? If so, he states what is not the fact.
Does he mean to assert, that the impulse to propagate the species,
call it lust, or love, is a principle as strong, as ungovernable, as
importunate, as uniform in its effects, as incapable of being subjected
to the control of reason, or circumstances, in short as much an affair
of mere physical appetite, as hunger? One would suppose so, for
he makes no distinction between them, but speaks of them both in
the same terms, as equally <em>necessary</em>, as equally fixed, and immutable
laws of our nature, the operation of which nothing short of a miracle
can suspend or alter. There are two circumstances, the mentioning
of which will however be sufficient to shew that the two kinds of
necessity here spoken of are not of the same order, or cogency,
and cannot be reasoned upon in the same manner, namely, that there
are many instances of persons who have lived all their lives without
any intercourse with the other sex, whereas there is no instance of
any person living without food; in the second place, what makes a
most marked distinction between the two cases, is that the longer
we have been accustomed to do without the indulgence of the one
appetite, the more tractable we find it, whereas the craving occasioned
by the want of food, the longer it continues, becomes more and more
pressing, and at last utterly ungovernable, and if not satisfied in time,
is sure in all cases whatever, without a single exception, to destroy
the person’s life. These two considerations are of themselves quite
sufficient to overturn the analogy which is here pretended to be set
up between love and hunger (a delicate comparison)—to shew that
the first of these impulses is not an affair of mere physical necessity,
that it does not operate always in the same way, and that it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>a thing, over which reason, or circumstances have no power. What
can be a stronger instance of the power of reason, or imagination,
or habit over this principle than the number of single women, who
in every country, till the manners become quite corrupt, preserve
either through their whole lives, or the best part of them the
greatest purity and propriety of conduct? One would think that
female modesty had been a flower that blossomed only in other
climes (instead of being the peculiar growth of our own time and
country!) that Mr. Malthus in the heat of his argument, and urged
on by the ardour of his own feelings, is blind to the example of so
many of his fair countrywomen, in whom the influence of a virtuous
education, of virtuous principles, and virtuous dispositions prevails over
the warmth of the passions and force of temptation. Mr. Malthus’s
doctrine is a most severe satire against the modesty and self-denial
of the other sex, and ruins in one sweeping clause the unblemished
reputations of all those expecting or desponding virgins who had
hitherto been supposed to live in the daily, hourly practice of this
virtue. Trenched as he is behind history, philosophy, and a knowledge
of human nature, he laughs at all their prudery and affectation,
and tells them fairly that the thing is impossible; and that unless a
miracle could be worked in their favour, they might as well pretend
to live without eating or drinking, or sleeping, as without the men.
He must be of opinion with Iago, that ‘their greatest merit is not to
leave it undone but keep it unknown.’ Surely, <em>no maid could live
near such a man</em>.—Though this is what Mr. Malthus <em>might</em> say,
it is not what he <em>does</em> say: on the other hand, when he comes to
particulars, (as he is rather a candid man, and does not trouble
himself much about consistency) instead of representing real chastity
as a kind of miracle or monster in nature, he represents it as a very
common thing and bears honourable testimony to the virtue of most
women, particularly in the middle and higher ranks of life, in this
respect. But then this virtue is confined entirely to the women;
the men neither do, nor ever will be able to practise it; and this
again salves the objection to his argument. But this is of all others
the strongest proof of the futility of Mr. Malthus’s reasoning: for to
what is this difference owing but to the opinion of the world respecting
their conduct, that is, to moral causes? It cannot be said I
presume that the greater command which the other sex have over
themselves is because their heads are stronger and their passions
weaker, (this would, I am sure, be out of all anatomical proportion):
it is owing solely to the institutions of society, imposing this
restraint upon them; though these institutions, if we are to believe
Mr. Malthus, can never in any circumstances whatever have any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>effect on this passion. It is impossible to add any thing to the force
and conclusiveness of this argument by enlarging upon it: it speaks
for itself. I can only say, that I am willing to rest the whole
controversy on this single fact. If the passion is thus capable of
being modified and influenced by circumstances, opinion, and manners,
and not merely slightly modified, or for a short time, in one or two
solitary instances, as an exception to the general rule (though even
this would shew that the necessity is not absolute, invincible, fatal)
but actually kept under (as far as it has any thing to do with population,
or child-bearing) by one half the sex in every well-regulated
community, I conceive Mr. Malthus can only be justified in saying,
that no possible circumstances will ever render this passion entirely
subject to the control of reason, by saying that no circumstances
will ever arrive in which it would be the imperious and indispensable
duty of every one to habituate himself to such restraint, in which
that necessity would be generally felt and understood and enforced
by the opinion of the whole community, and in which nothing but a
general system of manners formed upon that opinion could save the
community from ruin, or from the evils of excessive population,
which is point-blank contrary to Mr. Malthus’s whole doctrine.
In short, Mr. Malthus’s whole book rests on a malicious supposition,
that all mankind (I hope the reader will pardon the grossness of the
expression, the subject is a gross one) are like so many animals
<em>in season</em>. ‘Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, as
salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk,’
matters could then be no worse than he represents them. Population
could then only be checked by vice and misery and by nothing else.
But I hope things are not quite so bad.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Mr. Malthus says, ‘that
the passion between the sexes is necessary, or at least that it will
remain nearly in its present state.’ To this I might perhaps assent,
if I knew what ‘its present state’ is. Does Mr. Malthus mean by
its present state its present state in England or in Scotland, or in
Italy, or in Asia, or in Africa, or America, for in all or most of
these places is its present state a very different thing from what it is
in the rest of them? One would imagine from the easy complacency
with which Mr. Malthus treats the subject, that the present state of this
passion was a something really given, a fixed quantity, a general rule
like the relation between two and two and four, or <em>between food and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the human stomach</em>,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> that it was indulged universally and equally in all
countries, instead of being as various in itself and its effects as climate
and all other causes, natural and artificial, can make it.—Thus to give
an example as much in point as can be, is the present state of this
passion, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> of the indulgence of it, the same in Lancashire, that it
is in Westmoreland, the very next county to it? In the one you
find the most profligate manners, and the most extreme licentiousness,
in the other there is hardly any such thing. Mr. Malthus often says,
he will never dispute any thing that is proved by experience and a
real observation of human life. Now I conceive that the observation
which I have just stated is a <em>fact</em>. Yet Mr. Malthus seems to have
been quite insensible to this, and many other facts of the same kind.
But the truth is, that your practical reasoners, your matter-of-fact
men are the dullest of all mortals. They are like justices of the
peace who are bound to receive no evidence unless it is given in upon
oath, and who without descending from the bench and forfeiting the
dignity of their pretensions cannot attend to any of those general
surmises, those obvious sources of information or casual impressions,
by which other people arrive at common sense, and human feelings.—They
shut their eyes to the general face of nature, and trying to
grope their way by the help of facts as they call them, wander like
blind men from <em>pillar to post</em>, without either guide or object, and are
lost in a labyrinth of dates, names, capital letters, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">numeros</span>, official
documents, authenticated copies of lying affidavits, curious records
that are nothing to the purpose, registers of births, deaths, marriages,
and christenings, voyages and travels.—Mr. Malthus may perhaps
mean, when he says that ‘the sexual passion will remain nearly in
its present state,’ that it will remain in the same state in each country.
To this I should also assent, if I could agree with him, ‘that ever
since we have had any knowledge of mankind, the passion of which
we are speaking, appears to have been a fixed law of our nature, and
that as we have not hitherto seen any alteration in it, we have no
right to conclude that there will ever be any.’ If Mr. Malthus in
this passage meant to confine him to the passion or impulse itself, I
should not certainly be at much pains to contradict him. But that
is not the question. The question relates solely to the irregular
indulgence of, or the degree of restraint imposed on the passion; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in this respect his assertion is evidently false. The difference in the
state of manners in the same country at different periods is as striking
and notorious as that between the manners of different countries.
There is as much difference between what England was in this
respect a hundred and sixty years ago, and what she is now, as there
is between England and Italy at the present day. Was there no
difference between the manners of ancient Rome in the early periods
of her history, and towards the decline of the empire? May not the
state of manners in Italy under the republic, under the emperors, and
under the popes, be distinctly traced to the influence of religious or
political institutions, or to other causes, besides the state of population,
or the facility of gratifying the abstract instinctive propensity to
sexual indulgence? Was there not a striking difference between the
severity and restraint which was required and undoubtedly practised
under Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> and in the time of the Puritans, and that torrent of
dissipation and undisguised profligacy which burst upon the kingdom
after the restoration of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>? This sudden transition from
demure and saint-like or hypocritical austerity to open shameless
licentiousness cannot assuredly be accounted for from the increasing
pressure of population. Nor can it be pretended to have been owing
to this principle that the tide afterwards turned again at the Revolution
with the habits and fashions of the court, and with the views
and maxims of that party who had now got the ascendancy. A
learned writer might easily fill a volume with instances to the same
purpose. But the few which are here skimmed from the mere
surface of history, and which must be familiar to every one, are
sufficient to disprove Mr. Malthus’s assertion, not as a metaphysical
refinement, but as a practical rule, that the passion between the sexes
and the effects of that passion have remained always the same. The
indulgence of that passion is so far from being a law antecedent to
all other laws, and paramount to all other considerations, that it is
in a manner governed almost entirely by circumstances, and may be
said to be the creature of the imagination. But Mr. Malthus says,
that no regular or gradual progress has hitherto been made towards
the extinction of this passion, and that it exists in as much force at
present, as it did two thousand, or four thousand years ago. The
question is whether this passion is fixed and stationary, always
remaining at the same point, controuling circumstances, but not
controuled by them, not whether the change of circumstances and
lapse of time may not bring it back to the same point again. I think
it probable that if Mr. Malthus had to preach a sermon on the truth
and excellence of revealed religion, he would be inclined to take for
one of his topics the benefit we have derived from it in the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of our passions, and general purity of our manners. He might
launch out into a description shewing how the contemplation of
heavenly things weans the affections from the things of the world,
and mortifies our carnal desires, how a belief in future rewards and
punishments strengthens our resolution, and is indeed the only thing
that can render us proof against every species of temptation; he
might enlarge on the general purity and elevation which breathes
through the sacred writings, on the law confining the institution of
marriage to pairs; he might dwell on the grossness and pernicious
tendency of the Pagan mythology; he might glance at the epistle to
the Romans, or the preamble to the Jewish laws, and finding that
the practices there described are not common among <em>us</em>, without
travelling to Rome, or inquiring into the present state of Chaldæa,
conclude by felicitating his hearers on the striking contrast between
ancient and modern manners, and on the gradual improvement of
morals and refinement of sentiment produced by the promulgation
of christianity. Though we in general reason very incorrectly in
comparing ancient and modern manners, (for we always confound
the former with eastern, and the latter with our own manners) I am
apt to think that some change has taken place in this passion in the
course of time. It seems to be more modified by other feelings
than it used to be; it is less a boiling of the blood, an animal heat,
a headlong, brutal impulse than it was in past ages. The principle
is somewhat taken down and weakened, the appetite is not so strong,
we can stay our stomachs better than we used to do, we do not gorge
indiscriminately on every kind of food without taste or decency.
The vices of the moderns are more artificial than constitutional.
They do not arise so much from instinct as from a depraved will.
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. We stimulate ourselves
into affected passion: we are laborious imitators of folly, and ape the
vices of others in cold blood. But whatever may be the result of an
inquiry into the comparative state of ancient and modern manners, I
cannot allow that it has any thing to do with the present question.
I will allow that the progress of refinement and knowledge has in
ninety-nine instances out of a hundred tended to deprave instead of
improving the morals of men, that at the same time that it has taken
away the gross impulse, it has introduced an artificial and studied
depravity, the operation of which is more subtle, dangerous and
universal; in short that nations as they grow older like individuals
grow worse, not from constitution, but habit. Still this fact if
granted (and I am afraid it is too near the truth) will not at all
prove Mr. Malthus’s theory, that this passion remains always the
same, being influenced neither by time nor circumstances. Secondly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>it will not overturn the speculations respecting the possibility of
making an entire change in the passion ‘in a state of society
altogether different from any that has hitherto existed,’ but will on
the contrary render such a change more desirable and necessary, as
our only resource against the general contagion of vice and profligacy.
If this vice is found to spread gradually wider and wider, clinging to
the support of institutions, which in all other respects favour selfishness
and sensuality, if it is not the only one among the vices, which,
while all others spread and flourish and are fostered in the eye of
the world, does not hide its diminished head, this is not to be
wondered at. But it would be a singular way of defending the
present institutions of society, that from all our past experience we
find that their progress has been attended with the gradual corruption
of manners, and has uniformly ended in an utter debasement of
character and the relaxation of every moral tie; and it would be a
strange kind of inference to say that no alteration in the circumstances
or institutions of society would ever make men different from what
they are, because as long as those circumstances and institutions have
been known to exist, mankind have remained always the same, or
have been growing worse instead of better. Mr. Malthus denies
that Mr. Godwin has any right to conclude that because population
has not produced the dreadful effects he ascribes to it in any known
state of society, it would not therefore produce them in a state of
society quite different from any other; and in the same manner I
should deny that Mr. Malthus has any right to infer because the
progress of the human mind has not in the past history of the world
been productive of any very beneficial consequences, that it will never
be productive of any such consequences under very different circumstances.
Knowledge, as I have shewn in a former letter, is not
a necessary, absolute good: neither is it a necessary evil. Its
utility depends on the direction which is given to it by other
things; e.g. in Scotland, the case before alluded to, knowledge does
not seem to be the enemy of sobriety and good manners, but a
support to them. The decay in the purity and simplicity of Scotch
manners, whenever it arrives, will not I dare say be owing to the
increase of knowledge, but to the spread of luxury, or other external
causes. When the whole mass is tainted, it cannot be expected that
knowledge should escape the infection. All therefore that the
advocates for the future progressive improvement of mankind have
to prove in order to make out a consistent case, is that the state of
the passion between the sexes depends not upon physical, but moral
causes; that where these latter causes have been favourable to severity
of manners, and the elevation of the character, these effects have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>uniformly flowed from them, and may be seen not in one or two
singular exceptions, but in large classes of people, in the prevailing
manners of whole ages and nations. Thus we do not merely know
that Scipio was chaste, and Nero profligate, but we know that there
was nothing singular in the chastity of the one, or the profligacy of
the other; it was little more than the emanation of the character and
circumstances of the times in which they lived. The leaders of the
republican party in the time of Cromwell, such men as Milton,
Hampden, Pym, Marvel, Sydney, were not I believe in the command
over their passions exactly on a level with the young courtiers in the
following reign: but though the names of these men stand out and
ever will stand out in history, giving dignity to our nature in all its
parts, yet it is not to be supposed that they alone drank of the pure
waters of faith and reason, which flowed freely at that time; but that
the same lofty thoughts, the same common exertions, and the same
passions, growing out of the circumstances of the times, must have
imparted a sort of severe and high-toned morality to men’s minds in
general, influencing the national character in a very different way
from the foreign fopperies and foreign vices, from the train of
strumpets, buffoons, fiddlers, and obscene rhymers let loose upon
the people in the succeeding reign. It is not necessary to prove
that manners have always changed for the better, but that they have
always changed for the better, as far as those general causes have
operated in part, from the complete success of which a total change
is predicted. This passion as it runs into licentiousness is certainly
one great obstacle in the way of improvement, and one of those
passions which we must conquer before we can hope to become
perfectly reasonable beings (if this is a thing either desirable or
possible). But to say, that we may get a complete mastery over our
passions, and that we shall still be in danger from the principle of
population is to me a paradox. Population is only dangerous from
the excess of this passion, and I see no reason why its excesses may
not be restrained as well as those of any other passion. We find by
uniform experience that it is, like other passions, influenced by
example, institution, and circumstances, according to the degree of
strength they have; and if there is reason to suppose it possible that
any of the other passions should ever be totally eradicated, or
subjected to moral restraint, there is no reason why this should
not be so too. It does not form any anomaly to the other prevailing
passions of men. It is not, like hunger, a necessary instinct. Its
effects are more like those of drunkenness: and we might as well
make this latter vice an insurmountable objection to the good order
and happiness of society, by saying that there will always be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>many drunken disputes, brawls and riots, as there are at present,
because there are as many instances of people getting drunk now as
there were two thousand years ago, as pretend to deduce the same
consequence from the existence of such a passion as lust.—To judge
from his book, I should suppose Mr. Malthus to be a man of a warm
constitution, and amorous complexion. I should not hesitate in my
own mind, to conclude that this is ‘the sin that most easily besets
him.’ I can easily imagine that he has a sufficient command over
himself, in all other respects. I can believe that he is quite free
from the passions of anger, pride, avarice, sloth, drunkenness, envy,
revenge, and all those other passions which create so much disturbance
in the world. He seems never to have heard of, or never to have
felt them; for he passes them over as trifles beneath the notice of a
philosopher. But the women are <em>the devil</em>.—The delights and
torments of love no man, he tells us, ever was proof against: there
all our philosophy is useless; and reason but an empty name. ‘The
rich golden shaft hath killed the flock of all affections else,’ and here
only he is vulnerable. The smiles of a fair lady are to him irresistible;
the glimpse of a petticoat throws him into a flame; and all his senses
are up in arms, and his heart fails within him, at the very name of
love. His gallantry and devotion to the fair sex know no bounds;
and he not only answers for himself, but undertakes to prove that all
men are made of the same combustible materials. His book reminds
one of the title of the old play, ‘All for love, or the world well lost.’
If Mr. M.’s passions are too much for him, (though I should not
have the worse opinion of him on this account) I would advise him
to give vent to them in writing love-songs; not in treatises of
philosophy. I am aware, however, that it is dangerous to meddle
in such matters. As long as Mr. Malthus gravely reduces the
strength of the passion to a mathematical certainty, he is sure to
have the women on his side; while I, for having the presumption to
contradict his amorous conclusions, shall be looked upon as a sour old
batchelor, and convicted of rebellion against the omnipotence of love.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to return. It is the direct object of Mr. Malthus’s philosophy
to draw our attention from the slight and superficial influence which
human institutions have had on the happiness of man, to those
‘deeper-seated’ causes of misery which arise out of the principle of
population. These, he says, are by far the most important, and the
only ones worth our attending to, because they are the only ones on
which all our reasonings and all our exertions will have no effect.
He very roundly taxes Mr. Godwin and others as men who talked
about what they did not understand, because they did not perceive
that social institutions, and the different forms of government, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the other means in our power of affecting the condition of human life
are ‘but as the dust in the balance,’ compared with a principle
entirely out of our power, which renders the vices of those institutions
necessary, and any essential improvement in them hopeless. He is
also angry with Hume for saying something about ‘indolence.’ We
are in no case to look beyond the principle of population, in accounting
for the state of man in society, if we would not fall under Mr.
Malthus’s displeasure, but are to resolve every thing into that. In
his hands, population is the Aaron’s rod which swallowed up all the
other rods. The piety of some of the old divines led them to see all
things in God. Mr. Malthus’s self-complacency leads him to see
all things in the Essay. He would persuade us that his discovery
supersedes all other discoveries; that it is the category of political
science; that all other causes of human happiness and misery are
merged and sunk in that one, to which alone they owe their influence,
and their birth. So that we are in fact to consider all human
institutions, good, bad, and indifferent, all folly, vice, wisdom, virtue,
knowledge, ignorance, liberty and slavery, poverty and riches,
monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, polygamy, celibacy, all forms
and modes of life, all arts, manufactures, and science, as resulting
mechanically from this one principle; which though simple in itself,
yet in its effects is a jumble, a chaos of contradictions, a mass of
inconsistency and absurdity, which no human understanding can
unravel, or explain. Over this crew and medley of opinions, Mr.
Malthus ‘sits umpire, and by decision more embroils the fray by
which he reigns’: for he is not quite undetermined in his choice
between good and evil, but is always inclined to give the preference
to vice and misery, not only as the most natural, but as the most safe
and salutary effects of this principle, as we prescribe a low diet and
blisters to persons of too full a temperament. ‘Our greatest good is
but plethoric ill.’—Mr. Malthus may perhaps plead in his own
defence that at the outset of his work (second edition) he professes
to treat only of <em>one</em> of the causes which have hitherto impeded the
progress of virtue and happiness, and that he was not therefore, by
the terms of the agreement, bound to take cognizance of any of the
other causes which have tended to produce the same effect. He is
like a man who takes it into his head to make a huge map of
Scotland, (larger than any that ever was made of the whole world
besides) and gives you into the bargain as much or as little of
Ireland or the rest of Great Britain as he pleases. Any one else
who chuses, may make a map of England or Ireland on the same
scale. There is something fair and plausible in this. But the fact
really is, that Mr. Malthus will let nobody make a map of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>country but himself: he has put England, Wales, and Ireland in
the three corners of his great map (for the title takes up one of the
corners) and he insists upon it that this is quite sufficient.—What he
aims at in all his plans and calculations of existing grievances is to
magnify the evils of population, to exonerate human institutions, and
to throw the whole blame on nature herself. I shall therefore try to
give such a sketch, or bird’s-eye view of the subject as may serve to
shew the unfairness of our author’s statement. How little he has
confined himself to his professed object, and how little he can be
considered in the light of a joint-inquirer after truth, will be seen by
quoting the following passages at large.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The great error under which Mr. Godwin labours throughout
his whole work is, the attributing of almost all the vices and misery
that prevail in civil society to human institutions. Political regulations,
and the established administration of property are with him the fruitful
sources of all evil, the hotbeds of all the crimes that degrade mankind.
Were this really a true state of the case, it would not seem an
absolutely hopeless task to remove evil completely from the world;
and reason seems the proper and adequate instrument for effecting so
great a purpose. But the truth is, that though human institutions
<em>appear</em> to be the obvious and obtrusive causes of much mischief to
mankind, they are, in reality, light and superficial, in comparison
with those deeper-seated causes of evil which result from the laws
of nature.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Now by ‘the laws of nature,’ of which human institutions are here
made only a sort of <em>cat’s-paw</em>, our author means neither more nor less
than the principle of population. For after supposing in compliment
to Mr. Godwin, a state of society in which the spirit of oppression,
the spirit of servility, and the spirit of fraud, in which envy, malice,
and revenge, in which every species of narrowness and selfishness are
banished from the world, where war and contention have ceased to
exist, where unwholesome trades and manufactures are no longer
encouraged, &amp;c., he breaks out into his usual cant of, ‘I cannot conceive
a form of society so favourable upon the whole to population.’
He then proceeds gravely to shew, by a train of reasoning which has
been already recapitulated, and which need not surely be refuted
twice, how in such a state of happy equality population would go on
increasing without limit, because all obstacles to it, ‘all anxiety about
the future support of children,’ would be entirely removed, though it
would at the same time be attended in every stage of the progress
with increasing and aggravated wretchedness, because those very
obstacles, and the same difficulty of providing for the support of
children would still remain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>‘Here then,’ he says, ‘no human institutions existed, to the
perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the
worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between
public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those
advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had
been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had
established her reign in all hearts. And yet in so short a period as
fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice,
and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present
state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious
circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely
independent of all human regulations.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is a perfectly just observation of Mr. Godwin, that <em>there is a
principle in human society by which population is perpetually kept down to
the level of the means of subsistence</em>. The sole question is, what is this
principle? Is it some obscure and occult cause? Is it some
mysterious interference of heaven, which at a certain period strikes
the men with impotence, and the women with barrenness? Or is it
a cause open to our researches, within our view; a cause which has
constantly been observed to operate, though with varied force, in
every state in which man has been placed? Is it not misery and the
fear of misery,’ [certainly two very different things] ‘the necessary
and inevitable results of the laws of nature, which human institutions,
so far from aggravating, have tended considerably to mitigate, though
they can never remove?’ He then proceeds to shew how the distinctions
of property and the other regulations of society would
necessarily result from the principle of population, and adds, that
‘certainly if the great principle of the Essay be admitted, it affects
Mr. Godwin’s whole work, and essentially alters the foundations of
political justice. A great part of his book consists of an <em>abuse</em> of
human institutions’ [very sad indeed] ‘as productive of all or most of
the evils which afflict society. The acknowledgement of a new and
totally unconsidered cause of misery must evidently alter the state of
these arguments,’ [comfortable again] ‘and make it absolutely necessary
that they should be either newly modified, or <em>entirely rejected</em>.’—How
fortunate to have discovered that the evils in society are not owing to
a cause which might be remedied, but to one that renders their removal
absolutely hopeless!</p>

<p class='c011'>I might here, if I were to follow the impulse of my own levity,
say that the yellow fever has I believe made its appearance since the
first edition of Political Justice, though I do not know that this
circumstance would make it necessary entirely to new-model the
arguments. As to Mr. Malthus’s ‘new and unconsidered cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>misery,’ I deny that the necessity of providing a proportionable
quantity of food for an increase of people was new or unconsidered.
All that Mr. Malthus has discovered is that the population would go
on increasing, though there was nothing to support it!—Our author
has chosen to justify or palliate the real disorders which prevail in
society by supposing a case of fictitious distress; by which means he
proves incontestably that the present vices and defects of political
institutions, &amp;c. are <em>comparative</em> blessings. He supposes that in a
state of society where the public good was the constant guide of
action, men would entirely lay aside the use of their reason, and think
of nothing but begetting children, without considering in the least
how they were to be maintained. Now I will also for a time take a
license from common sense, and make a supposition as wise as
Mr. Malthus’s. I will suppose all the inhabitants of this town to
come to a determination to live without eating, and do nothing but
drink gin. What would be the consequence? Perpetual intoxication,
quarrels, the fierceness of hunger, disease, idleness, filth, nakedness,
maudlin misery, sallow faces, sights of famine and despair, meagre
skeletons, the dying, and the dead. But why need I attempt to
describe what has been already so much better described by
Hogarth? Here then, I might exclaim, no human institutions
existed, no unjust laws, no excessive labour, no unwholesome trades,
no inequality, no malice, envy, lust, or revenge, to produce the
dreadful catastrophe we just have witnessed: yet in the short space of
a single month or fortnight we see that scenes of distress, shocking
beyond any thing of which we can at present form even a conception,
would arise out of the most imperious circumstances, from laws
inherent in the nature and constitution of man, and absolutely independent
of all human regulations, namely, <em>from the unrestricted use
of gin</em>. The inference is direct and unavoidable, that we ought to
submit patiently and thankfully to all the abuses, vices, and evils
that are to be found in this great city, and flatter, excuse, and
encourage them by all the means in our power, <em>because</em> they all of
them together do not amount to a tenth part of the mischief that
would be the consequence of the unrestrained indulgence of a single
pernicious habit. This is something the way in which Mr. Malthus
reasons about the unrestricted increase of population. But the
absurdity is too gross even for burlesque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is, I conceive, a fair summary of Mr. Malthus’s
theory. First, that the principle of population is a necessary,
mechanical thing, that it is the ‘grinding law of necessity,’ unavoidably
leading to a certain degree of vice and misery, and in fact
accounting for almost all the evils in human life. Secondly, that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the other sources of vice and misery which have been so much and
idly insisted on, have no tendency to increase the necessary evils of
population, but the contrary, or that the removal of those different
sources of evil would instead of lessening the evils of population,
which are much the most important, really aggravate them. Here
then three questions naturally present themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, how much of the vice and misery in society is actually
owing to human institutions, or the passions, follies, imperfections,
or perversities of human nature, independently of the principle of
population.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, whether the removing or diminishing the evils produced
by those causes would necessarily increase the evils of
population, and open a door to the influx of more vice and misery
than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly, whether the tendency of population to excess is the
effect of a simple principle operating mechanically, whether it is to
be looked upon as one of the laws inherent in our very nature, or
whether the state of morals in every country does not depend greatly
and principally on the state of society, on the condition of the people,
on public opinion, and on a variety of other causes which are more
or less within our power; that is, whether human institutions, laws,
&amp;c. instead of being the mere blind instruments of this principle, do
not re-act very powerfully upon it, and give it its direction and
limits.—If it can be shewn under this last head, that there is some
connection between the form of government and the state of morals,
and that the better the government, the better the morals, the evils
of population instead of forming an excuse for bad governments will
only aggravate their mischief, and increase the necessity of getting
rid of them. Again, if it can be made to appear that there is no
necessary, or general proportion between the degree of vice in any
country, and the pressure of population on the means of subsistence,
that it is not always the effect of want, but constantly outruns the
occasion, being self-propagated, and often spreading like a contagion
through those countries and those ranks in life, where the difficulty of
providing for a family is least felt, this will shew that the mere
existence of vice is no proof of its being necessary, or that it
is to be considered as a test of the excessive increase of population.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther, if on the other hand, improving the condition of the
lower classes of the people is generally found, instead of leading to
an unrestrained increase of population, and thus adding to their
misery, to give them a greater attachment to the decencies and
comforts of life, to make them more cautious how they part with
them, to open their ideas and prospects, to strengthen the principle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>moral restraint, and so confine population within reasonable limits,
this will be an additional motive for improving their condition (really
and truly, not by taking from them the comforts and privileges they
already possess). Again, if it should be found that independently of
the immediate acts of tyranny exercised by particular governments,
and the poverty and wretchedness experienced by certain classes of
the community there is a tendency in some governments to keep
population down infinitely below the level to which it might rise by
a proper encouragement of agriculture, and the methods of industry
by which population is supported, it will be but a poor defence of the
folly or tyranny of such governments to say, that they are a necessary
expedient to prevent the excess of population.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, if those states or communities, where the greatest equality
prevails, are those which maintain the greatest number of inhabitants,
and where the principle of moral restraint is likely to operate with
most effect, that is, where population is soonest able to reach its
utmost limits, and goes the least beyond them, certainly those institutions
which favour the greatest disparity of conditions, the extremes
of poverty and the extremes of luxury, will receive no very striking
support from the principle of population. These are I think the chief
points and inferences to which I wish to direct the reader’s attention
in the few slight remarks which I have to make upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be proper to observe, in the first place, that Mr. Malthus
by making vice and misery the necessary consequences of his favourite
principle lays himself open to a very obvious objection. For if he
means to prove any thing by his theory, the question immediately is,
what degree of vice and misery is rendered necessary by this principle,
or by the <em>physical constitution of man</em>? Are we to suppose that only
so much evil is necessary as naturally grows out of the British constitution?
Or does this principle also prove that all the evils that are
suffered under the Turkish government, or that were suffered under
the old government of France, or that may arise out of its present
government are equally necessary and salutary? How far are we to
go? Where are we to stop? Are we to consider every evil and
abuse as necessary, merely because it exists, or only as much of the
thing as we cannot get rid of? But how much can we really get rid
of? Are vice and misery uniformly owing to the development of
this principle in certain situations, or are they to be in part ascribed
to the intervention of other arbitrary, and gratuitous causes, the operation
of which may be more easily set aside? In what manner are we
to distinguish between what is necessary, and what is not? All these
questions require to be asked before we can proceed to build any
practical conclusions on Mr. Malthus’s theory of the evils of population.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The vague, general term, ‘vice and misery,’ gives us no clue.
It is mere cant; and applies equally to the best and worst of all
possible governments. It proves either nothing, or it proves a great
deal more than I conceive Mr. Malthus would in all cases wish to
prove by it.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no species of vice or oppression that does not find a ready
excuse in this kind of reasoning. And besides, by leaving the
quantity of vice and misery always uncertain, we never subject ourselves
to the necessity of following a general principle into any
obnoxious conclusions; and are always at liberty to regulate our
opinions according to our convenience by saying—I would have no
more vice and misery than at present prevails: but that degree of
vice and misery which is inwoven with the present constitution of
things, I would by no means have removed, it might endanger the
whole fabric. This is a double advantage. We thus sacrifice to
the powers that be, without violating decorum, or being driven off
our guard by an inflexible and pedantic logic. I have so good an
opinion of Mr. Malthus that I do not think he has any predilection
for vice and misery in the abstract, or for their own sakes: I do not
believe he would stand forward as the advocate of any abuses from
which he himself does not reap some benefit, or which he may not
get something by defending.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not know that I can go so far as with Mr. Godwin to ascribe
the original sin of the worst men to social institutions, but of this I
am very sure that that original sin and those institutions do not proceed
entirely from the principle of population. There are other vices
and mischievous propensities inherent in our nature, besides the love
of pleasure. We are troubled with a complication of disorders, and
it is bad advice to say, that we ought to direct all our attention to the
one that is perhaps the most inveterate, or because we despair of
doing any thing with that, make no attempts to counteract the progress
of the others, either by palliatives or otherwise. If we are deceived
with respect to the real extent, and sources of our disorders, it is
impossible we should hit upon the right method of cure, whatever
might be the case, if we were informed of our true situation.—The
principle of population alone, according to the description Mr. Malthus
gives of it as a principle of unbridled and insatiable lust, would indeed
be sufficient to account for all the vice and misery in the world, and
for a great deal more than there is in the world. It would soon
overturn every thing. But we have seen that that account is not
just. It is in fact only one of the principles or passions by which
the conduct of mankind is influenced; and he would be a bold man
who should assert that neither ambition, nor avarice, nor sloth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>nor ignorance, nor prejudice have had any share in producing the
various evils that abound in civil society. The other passions are
sturdy claimants and know how to bustle for themselves, and will not
be so easily pushed out of the world. Let any one write the words,
ambition, pride, cruelty, hatred, oppression, falsehood, selfishness,
indolence, lust, and hunger in the same line, and let him see if there
is any peculiar charm in the two last, which draws all their virtue
and meaning out of the rest. Yet this is the impression which
Mr. Malthus seems anxious to leave on the minds of his readers.
Indeed all the others appear to owe their efficacy and their sting to
lust alone. If it were not for this one principle, the world might go
on very well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus charges it as a great error on Mr. Godwin’s system
that ‘political regulations and the established administration of property
are with him the fruitful sources of all evil, the hotbeds of all
the crimes that degrade mankind.’ Be it so, that this is an error.
The next question is, as Mr. Malthus does not deny that these
institutions are the immediate causes of many of the evils that exist,
to what principle they really owe their rise. Mr. Malthus says,
they are the necessary results of laws inherent in our nature, and that
though all the other passions and vices of men could be got rid of
altogether, the principle of population alone would still render those
institutions with all the abuses belonging to them as necessary as ever.
This I take upon me to dispute. Will he say, that (leaving the
principle of population entirely out of the question) pride, avarice,
and indolence have had no share in the establishment, or continuance
of the inequality of property, in goading men on to the accumulation
of immense riches by oppression, extortion, fraud, perjury, and every
species of villainy, or in making them undergo every kind of distress,
sooner than apply themselves to some regular and useful occupation.
If I were inclined to maintain a paradox on the subject, I might take
up Hume’s assertion, ‘that indolence is the source of all mischief in
the world.’ For if men had not been averse to labour, if there had
been no idlers to take advantage of, to offer temptation to, and enlist
upon any terms in any lawless enterprize, that promised an easy
booty, the tyrant would have been without his slaves, the robber
without his gang, and the rich man without his dependents. But
these smart points and pithy sayings are soon found to be fallacious,
if we attend a little closely to the subject. For instance, it may be
true that if there had been no idle people, there would have been no
one to take advantage of, but if there had been no pride, rapacity, or
selfishness, there would have been no one to take an undue advantage
of them, or foment the mischief. The fellows that generally compose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>a gang of robbers only wish to gain a cheap livelihood by acts of
violence; the captain of the gang is also actuated by vanity, revenge,
the spirit of adventure, and the desire to keep the country for twenty
or thirty miles round in awe of him. The common soldier is glad of
sixpence a-day to be shot at every now and then, and do nothing the
rest of his time: the general is not easy, unless he can lay waste
provinces, overrun kingdoms, and make the world ring with the terror
of his name. The lazy and unthinking would not do half the mischief,
of which they are capable, without the active, the enterprizing
and turbulent: fools and knaves are as necessary to the body politic,
as the head and limbs are to the human body. The Romans might
have staid quietly within their own walls, but for the plotting heads
at home that sent them out to victory; and his thirty thousand
followers would no more have thought of setting out to India of their
own accord, than Alexander would have thought of marching there
by himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to me pretty clear that as long as there are such passions as
sloth and rapacity, these will be sufficient to account for the unequal
division of property, and will render the laws relating to it necessary:
and it is equally clear to my mind that if these passions could be
completely subdued, so that no one would refuse his share in the
common labour, or endeavour to take an unfair advantage of others
either by force or fraud, that the established administration of property
would be no longer necessary.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> If, as Mr. Malthus supposes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>‘Benevolence had so far established her reign in all hearts,’ that
every one was ready to give up the enjoyments of ease and luxury as
far as related to himself, I do not think that in such a state of
unparalleled disinterestedness and heroic virtue, any madman would
be found to violate the public happiness, and begin the work of contention
anew, for the sake of transmitting a contingent inheritance of
vice and misery <em>to his heirs</em>! If reason and virtue are at present no
match for the principle of population, neither are they a match for
the principle of selfishness, or for any of our other passions. But
truly, if benevolence had once established her reign in all hearts, we
should see wonders, she would perform the part of vice and misery
to a miracle.—It is evident then that the seeds of inequality, of vice
and misery are not sown entirely in the principle of population; that
the same untoward passions which first rendered civil establishments
necessary, have continued to operate ever since, that they have produced
most of the disorders in the world, and are still in as much
force as ever; that they very well deserve a chapter by themselves in
the history of human nature, and ought not to come in as a note or
parenthesis to Mr. Malthus’s great work.</p>

<p class='c011'>But whatever account we may chuse to give of the origin of the
establishment of property or government in general, this has nothing
to do with the real question, unless it could be shewn that the same
form of government, the same inequality of conditions, and the same
degree of vice and misery are to be found alike in every country.
Mr. Malthus’s system goes to the support of all political regulations
and existing evils, or it goes to the support of none. Let us cast our
eyes over the map of Europe, and ask whether all that variety of
governments and manners by which it is distinguished took their rise
solely from the principle of population. A principle common to
human nature, a law inherent in the physical constitution of man,
may in its progress be necessarily attended with a certain degree of
vice and misery; but it cannot be productive of different degrees of
vice and misery in different countries; as the stern law of necessity,
it must operate every where alike. If it does not do so, this of itself
shews that it is not the sole moving spring in all human institutions,
that it is not beyond the reach of all regulation and control, and that
there are other circumstances, accidents, and principles on which the
happiness of nations depends. Whatever difference there is, then,
between one government and another, whether that government is
despotic, or mixed, or free; whatever difference there is in the
administration of that government, whether it is cruel, oppressive, and
arbitrary in the extreme, or mild, just, and merciful; whatever difference
there is between the manners of one nation and those of another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>whether the most licentious that can be, or strict and exemplary;
whatever difference there is in the arts and conveniences of life, in
the improvements of trade and agriculture in various countries, whatever
differences are produced by religion, by contrarieties of opinion,
by the state of knowledge, by useful or mischievous regulations of all
kinds, all these cannot be owing to one and the same cause.</p>

<p class='c011'>Will Mr. Malthus say that all these differences are as nothing,
that they are not worth insisting on, or contending about, that they
are nominal, rather than real, or at any rate that what is gained in
one way is lost in another, for that the principle of population still
requires the same vent, and produces first or last the same quantity of
vice and misery of one sort or other in every country? He must
assert on the one hand that all other causes put together do not
materially affect the happiness of a people, or on the other hand that
the state of all those other causes depends on, and arises out of the
state of population, though they do not in the least influence the
principle of population itself. These absurdities, than which it would
be difficult to advance greater, are however necessary to bear out the
author’s conclusion, that arts, knowledge, liberty and virtue, and the
best institutions can do little for the happiness of mankind. For
instance, if it is true that religion or opinion of any kind exerts a
direct influence over morals, then it is not true that morals depend
entirely on the state of population. Or if it is true, that the invention
of a useful art, which is accident, or the public encouragement of it,
which is design, may contribute to the support of a larger population
without multiplying its inconveniences, then it is not true that all human
happiness or misery can be calculated according to a mechanical ratio.
But these matters are, I confess, set in the clearest light by a reference
to facts, and I can quote no better authority than Mr. Malthus
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>He says, ‘It will not be difficult, from the accounts of travellers, to
trace the checks to population, and the causes of its present decay [in
Turkey]; and as there is little difference in the <em>manners</em> of the
Turks, whether they inhabit Europe or Asia, it will not be worth
while to make them the subject of distinct consideration.’ [I shall
presume that I have so far reconciled the reader’s mind to the bugbear,
population, that he will not regard <em>depopulation</em> as one of the
most beautiful features in the economy of a state.]</p>

<p class='c011'>Our author then proceeds, ‘The fundamental cause of the low
state of population in Turkey, compared with its extent of territory,
is undoubtedly the nature of its government. Its tyranny, its feebleness,
its bad laws and worse administration of them, with the consequent
insecurity of property, throw such obstacles in the way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>agriculture, that the means of subsistence are necessarily decreasing
yearly, and with them, of course, the number of people. The <em>miri</em>
or general land-tax, paid to the sultan, is in itself moderate; but by
abuses inherent in the Turkish government, the pachas, and their
agents have found out the means of rendering it ruinous. Though
they cannot absolutely alter the impost which has been established by
the sultan, they have introduced a number of changes, which, without
the name, produce all the effect of an augmentation. In Syria,
according to Volney, having the greatest part of the land at their
disposal, they clog their concessions with burthensome conditions,
and exact the half, and sometimes even two-thirds of the crop.
When the harvest is over, they cavil about losses, and, as they have
the power in their hands, they carry off what they think proper.’
[What they leave behind them, is what Mr. Malthus when he gets
into his abstractions calls ‘<em>the fund appropriated to the maintenance of
labour</em>,’ or, ‘<em>the aggregate quantity of food possessed by the owners of
land beyond their own consumption</em>.’] ‘If the season fail, they still
exact the same sum, and expose every thing that the poor peasant
possesses to sale. To these constant oppressions are added a thousand
accidental extortions. Sometimes a whole village is laid under contribution
for some real or imaginary offence. Arbitrary presents are
exacted on the accession of each governor; grass, barley, and straw
are demanded for his horses’; [Mr. Malthus thinks, farther on in
his book, that ‘the waste of the rich, and the horses kept for pleasure’
in this country are no detriment to the poor <em>here</em>, but rather a benefit,
page 478.] ‘and commissions are multiplied, that the soldiers who
carry the orders may live upon the starving peasants, whom they
treat with the most brutal insolence and injustice. The consequence
of these depredations is, that the poorer class of inhabitants, ruined,
and unable any longer to pay the <em>miri</em>, become a burden to the village,’
[something I suppose in the same way that the poor among us become
a burden to the parish] ‘or fly into the cities; but the <em>miri</em> is unalterable,
and the sum to be levied must be found somewhere. The
portion of those who are thus driven from their homes falls on the
remaining inhabitants, whose burden, though at first light, now
becomes insupportable. If they should be visited by two years of
drought and famine, the whole village is ruined and abandoned; and
the tax, which it should have paid, is levied on the neighbouring
lands. The same mode of proceeding takes place with regard to the
tax on Christians, which has been raised by these means,’ [by what
means, by the principle of population?] ‘from three, five, and eleven
piastres, at which it was first fixed, to thirty-five and forty, which
absolutely impoverishes those on whom it is levied, and obliges them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to leave the country. It has been remarked that these exactions
have made a rapid progress during the last forty years, from which
time are dated the decline of agriculture, the depopulation of the
country, and the diminution in the quantity of the specie carried to
Constantinople. The peasants are every where reduced to a little
flat cake of barley, or <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">doura</span></i>, onions, lentils, and water. Not to lose
any part of their corn they leave in it all sorts of wild grain, which
often produces bad consequences. In the mountains of Lebanon and
Nablous, in time of dearth, they gather the acorns from the oak
which they eat after boiling or roasting them on the ashes. By a
natural consequence of this misery, the art of cultivation is in the most
deplorable state. The husbandman is almost without instruments,
and those he has are very bad. His plough is frequently no more
than the branch of a tree cut below a fork and used without wheels.
The ground is tilled by asses and cows, rarely by oxen, which would
bespeak too much riches. In the districts exposed to the Arabs, as
in Palestine, the countryman must sow with his musket in his hand,
and scarcely does the corn turn yellow before it is reaped and concealed
in subterraneous caverns. As little as possible is employed
for seed corn, because the peasants sow no more than is barely
necessary for their subsistence. Their whole industry is limited to
the supply of their immediate wants, and to procure a little bread, a
few onions, a blue shirt, and a bit of woollen, much labour is not
necessary. The peasant lives therefore in distress, but at least he
does not enrich his tyrants, and the avarice of despotism is its own
punishment.’ [<em>Note.</em>—These are the unhappy persons, as our author
expresses it in a passage, which may hereafter be quoted at length,
‘who in the great lottery of life have drawn a blank; and with whose
exorbitant and unreasonable demands the owners of the aforesaid
surplus produce neither think it just nor natural to comply.’ I
confess, I cannot account for all the contention and distress which is
here implied, for the conflict between famine and riches, when I
seriously consider with Mr. Malthus, ‘that the quantity of food,
which one man can consume, is necessarily limited by the narrow
capacity of the human stomach; that it is not certainly probable that
he should throw away the rest; or if he exchanged his surplus
produce for the labour of others, that this would be better than that
these others should absolutely <em>starve</em>.’ But human life, as well as
our reasonings about it, is a mystery, a dream.] ‘This picture which
is drawn by Volney, in describing the state of the peasants in Syria,
seems to be confirmed by all the other travellers in these countries,
and according to Eton, it represents very nearly the condition of the
peasants in the greater part of the Turkish dominions. Universally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the offices of every denomination are set up to public sale, and in the
intrigues of the seraglio, by which the disposal of all places is
regulated, every thing is done by means of bribes. The pachas in
consequence, who are sent into the provinces, exert to the utmost
their power of extortion, but are always outdone by the officers
immediately below them, who, in their turn, leave room for their
subordinate agents. The pacha must raise money to pay the tribute,
and also to indemnify himself for the purchase of his office; support
his dignity, and make a provision in case of accidents; and as all
power, both civil and military, centers in his person, from his representing
the sultan, the means are at his discretion, and the quickest
are invariably considered as the best. Uncertain of to-morrow, he
treats his province as a mere transient possession, and endeavours to
reap, if possible, in one day, the fruit of many years, without the
smallest regard to his successor, or the injury that he may do to the
permanent revenue. The cultivator is necessarily more exposed to
these extortions than the inhabitants of the towns. From the nature
of his employment, he is fixed to one spot, and the productions of
agriculture do not admit of being easily concealed. <em>The tenure of the
land and the right of succession are besides uncertain.</em> When a father
dies, the inheritance reverts to the sultan, and the children can only
redeem the succession by a considerable sum of money. These considerations
naturally occasion an indifference to landed estates. The
country is deserted, and each person is desirous of flying to the towns,
where he will not only in general meet with better treatment, but may
hope to acquire a species of wealth, which he can more easily conceal
from the eyes of his rapacious masters. To complete the ruin of
agriculture, a maximum is in many cases established, and the peasants
are obliged to furnish the towns with corn at a fixed price. It is a
maxim of Turkish policy, originating in the feebleness of the
government, and the fear of popular tumults, to keep the price of corn
low in all the considerable towns. In the case of a failure in the
harvest, every person who possesses any corn is obliged to sell it at
the price fixed, under pain of death: and if there be none in the
neighbourhood, other districts are ransacked for it. When Constantinople
is in want of provisions, ten provinces are perhaps famished
for a supply. At Damascus, during a scarcity in 1784, the people
paid only one penny farthing a pound for their bread, while the
peasants in the villages were absolutely dying with hunger. <em>The effect
of such a system of government</em> on agriculture, need not be insisted on.
The causes of the decreasing means of subsistence are but too
obvious; and the checks which keep the population down to the level
of these decreasing resources, may be traced with nearly equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>certainty, and will appear to include almost every species of vice and
misery.’ Happy country, secured by the very nature of its government
from the terrors of increasing population, and where every
species of vice and misery, wisely anticipated, on the principle that
the imagination of a thing is worse than the reality, takes away all fear
of any greater evils than those they already endure!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same chapter, he says, that in Persia ‘the lower classes of
people are obliged to defer marriage till late; and that it is only
among the rich that this union takes place early. The dreadful convulsions
to which this country has been subject for many hundred
years, must have been fatal to her agriculture. The periods of repose
from external wars, and internal commotions have been short and few,
and even during the times of profound peace, the frontier provinces
have been constantly subject to the ravages of the Tartars.—The effect
of this state of things is such as might be expected. The proportion
of uncultivated to cultivated land, Sir John Chardin states to be, ten
to one; and the mode in which the officers of the state and private
owners let out their lands to husbandmen, is not that <em>which is best
calculated to reanimate industry</em>. The other checks to population in
Persia are nearly the same as those in Turkey. <em>The superior destruction
of the plague in Turkey is perhaps nearly balanced by the greater
frequency of internal commotions in Persia.</em>’</p>

<p class='c011'>These extracts furnish, I think, a tolerably clear idea of the
manner in which it is possible for human institutions to aggravate
instead of mitigating the <em>necessary</em> evils of population. We have a
sufficient specimen of the effects of bad government, of bad laws, of
the worse execution of them, of feeble and selfish policy, of wars and
commotions, or of diseases probably occasioned for the most part by
the numbers of people who are huddled together in dirt and poverty
in the great towns in the manner we have seen—in altering the
natural proportion between the produce of the soil, and the maintenance
of the inhabitants; in wantonly diminishing the means of
subsistence by a most unjust and unequal distribution of them; in
diverting the produce of industry from its proper channels, in drying
up its sources, in causing a stagnation of all the motives and principles
which animate human life, in destroying all confidence, independence,
hope, cheerfulness, and manly exertion, in thwarting the bounties of
nature by waste, rapacity, extortion and violence, and spreading want,
misery, and desolation in their stead. How admirably does Mr.
Malthus balance his checks! What the plague does in Turkey, is in
Persia happily effected by means of civil commotions. Population is
thus kept down to the level of the means of subsistence. But it seems,
that wars, and intestine commotions, those blind drudges of Providence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in clearing away the filth, rubbish, and other evils of a too crowded
population, sometimes go beyond their errand, or do their work the
wrong way, by striking at the root of population instead of lopping off
its superfluous branches. According to our author’s general system,
the killing ten, or twenty, or a hundred thousand men is an evil of
a very trifling magnitude, if it is to be looked upon as an evil at all.
Population will only go on with the greater alacrity, marriage will be
rendered more practicable, and the deficiency will soon be supplied
from the sprightly and ever-teeming source of nature. The dreadful
convulsions, however, to which Persia has been subject for so many
hundred years have not been merely vents to carry off the excess of
population beyond the means of subsistence, but they have further
been fatal to agriculture itself, or to those very means of subsistence.
The proportion of <em>uncultivated</em>, to <em>cultivated</em> land, we find, is ten to
one; so that the population is not only reduced to a level with the
means of subsistence, but reduced ten times lower than it need be.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I beg leave to accompany this description of the effects of political
regulations and the established administration of property in Turkey,
with the following critical commentary, taken from another part of
the same work, which will throw considerable light on the <em>necessity</em> of
those institutions to prevent the evils of population. Mr. Malthus’s
usual plea for ‘vice and misery,’ is that nothing else can put a stop to
the excesses of population; which <em>they</em> do in the most effectual and
eligible manner. But he has here deserted his idols.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It has appeared, I think, clearly, in the review of different
societies given in the former part of this work, that those countries,
the inhabitants of which were sunk in the most barbarous ignorance,
or oppressed by the most cruel tyranny, however low they might
be in actual population, were very populous in proportion to their
means of subsistence; and upon the slightest failure of the seasons,
generally suffered the severities of want.’ [Yet it was the sole
object of Mr. Malthus’s discovery to prove the converse proposition,
that the highest degree of knowledge, and a perfect exemption from
every species of tyranny would only lead to the lowest state of human
wretchedness.]—‘Ignorance and despotism seem to have no tendency
to destroy the passion which prompts to increase; <em>but they effectually
destroy the checks to it from reason and foresight</em>. The improvident
barbarian who thinks only of his present wants, or the miserable
peasant, who from his political situation feels little security of reaping
what he has sown, will seldom be deterred from gratifying his passions
by the prospect of inconveniences which cannot be expected to press
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>on him under three or four years. But though this want of foresight,
which is fostered by ignorance and despotism, tend thus rather to
encourage the procreation of children, it is absolutely fatal to the
industry which is to support them. Industry cannot exist without
foresight and security. The indolence of the savage is well known;
and the poor Egyptian or Abyssinian farmer, without capital, who
rents land, which is let out yearly to the highest bidder and who is
constantly subject to the demands of his tyrannical masters, to the
casual plunder of an enemy, and not unfrequently to the violation of
his miserable contract, can have no heart to be industrious, and if he
had, could not exercise that industry with success. Even poverty
itself, which appears to be the great spur to industry, when it has
once passed certain limits, almost ceases to operate. The indigence
which is hopeless, destroys all vigorous exertion, and confines the
efforts to what is sufficient for bare existence. <em>It is the hope of
bettering our condition and the fear of want, rather than want itself, that
is the best stimulus to industry, and its most constant and best directed
efforts will almost invariably be found among a class of people above the
class of the wretchedly poor.</em>’</p>

<p class='c011'>What a pity that a man, who writes so well at times, should, for
the sake of an hypothesis, involve ‘himself in absurdities and contradictions
that would disgrace the lips of an ideot.’ Mr. Malthus
will excuse me, if I make use of some of the hints contained in this
excellent passage, for the benefit of our English poor, who I think
should not have harder measure dealt them than others, and try to
soften some of the harshest constructions of the grinding law of
necessity in their favour. I do not see why they alone are to be the
martyrs of an abstraction. But Mr. Malthus reserves the application
of his theory <em>in its purity</em> for his own countrymen. He has some
natural feelings, and a certain degree of tender weakness for the distresses
of other countries, but he will not suffer his feelings for a
moment to get the better of his reason, with regard to those to whom
he is bound by stronger ties, and over whose interests he watches
with a paternal anxiety. He will hear of no palliations, no excuses,
no shuffling temporary expedients to put off the evil day, he insists
upon their submitting to the full operation of the penalty incurred by
the laws of God and of nature, nothing short of the utmost severity
will satisfy him, (’tis death to spare) he will not bate them a jot of
his argument, he makes them drain the unsavoury cup of misery to
the very dregs.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same chapter, which is entitled ‘Of the principal sources of
the prevailing errors on population,’ he says, ‘It has been observed
that many countries at the period of their greatest populousness have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>lived in the greatest plenty, and have been able to export corn; but
at other periods, when their population was very low, have lived in
continual poverty and want, and have been obliged to import corn.
Egypt, Palestine, Rome, Sicily, and Spain are cited as particular
exemplifications of this fact; and it has been inferred, that an increase
of population in any state, not cultivated to the utmost, will tend
rather to augment than diminish the relative plenty of the whole
society,’ &amp;c. After contradicting this inference without giving any
reasons against it, he goes on, ‘Scarcity and extreme poverty, therefore,
may or may not accompany an increasing population, according
to circumstances. But they must always accompany a permanently
declining population; because there has never been, nor probably ever
will be, any other cause than want of food, which makes the population
of a country permanently decline. In the numerous instances
of depopulation which occur in history, the causes of it may always
be traced to the want of industry, or the ill-direction of that industry,
arising from violence, bad government, ignorance, &amp;c. which first
occasions a want of food, and of course depopulation follows. When
Rome adopted the custom of importing all her corn, and laying all
Italy into pasture, she soon declined in population. The causes of
the depopulation of Egypt and Turkey have already been alluded to;
and in the case of Spain, it was certainly not the numerical loss of
people, occasioned by the expulsion of the Moors; but the industry
and capital thus expelled, which permanently injured her population.’
[I do not myself see, how the expulsion of capital could permanently
injure the population.] ‘When a country has been depopulated by
violent causes, if a bad government, with its usual concomitant, insecurity
of property, ensue, which has generally been the case in all
those countries which are now less peopled than formerly; neither
the food nor the population, will recover themselves, and the inhabitants
will probably live in severe want,’ &amp;c. Yet Mr. Malthus
elsewhere affects to consider all human institutions and contrivances
as perfectly indifferent to the question. We have here, however, a
truer account of the matter. The state of population is evidently no
proof of what it might be: to judge whether it is more or less than
it might or ought to be, we must take into consideration good and
bad government, the progress of civilization, &amp;c. It is a thing <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
facto</span></i>, not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i>. It is not that rock, against which whosoever sets
himself shall be dashed to pieces, but the clay moulded by the potter
into vessels of honour or dishonour. With respect to Spain, it is
allowed that her population is deficient, or short of what it might be.
The problem of political economy I take to be, how far this is
the case with respect to all other countries, and how to remedy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>defect; or how to support the greatest number of people in the
greatest degree of comfort. But I have said this more than once
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the same purpose I might quote Algernon Sydney, who in
his Discourses on government gives the following account of the
decline and weakness of many of the modern states from the loss of
liberty.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>‘I take Greece to have been happy and glorious, when it was full
of populous cities, flourishing in all the arts that deserve praise among
men; when they were courted and feared by the greatest kings, and
never assaulted by any but to his own loss and confusion; when
Babylon and Susa trembled at the motion of their arms: and their
valour, exercised in those wars and tumults, which our author
[Filmer] looks upon as the greatest evils, was raised to such a
power, that nothing upon earth was found able to resist them. And
I think it now miserable, when peace reigns within their empty walls,
and the poor remains of those exhausted nations, sheltering themselves
under the ruins of the desolated cities, have neither any thing
that deserves to be disputed among them, nor spirit or force to
repel the injuries they daily suffer from a proud and insupportable
master.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The like may be said of Italy. Whilst it was inhabited by
nations governing themselves by their own will, they fell sometimes
into domestic seditions, and had frequent wars with their neighbours.
When they were free, they loved their country and were always ready
to fight in its defence. Such as succeeded well, increased in vigour
and power; and even those which were the most unfortunate in one
age, found means to repair their losses, if their government continued.
While they had a property in their goods, they would not suffer the
country to be invaded, since they knew they could have none, if it
were lost. This gave occasion to wars and tumults; it sharpened
their courage, kept up a good discipline, and the nations that were
most exercised by them, always increased in power and number: so
that no country seems ever to have been of greater strength than Italy
was when Hannibal invaded it, and after his defeat the rest of the
world was not able to resist their valour and power. They sometimes
killed one another; but their enemies never got any thing but burying-places
within their territories. All things are now brought into a
very different method by the blessed governments they are under.
The fatherly care of the king of Spain, the pope, and other princes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>has established peace among them. We have not in many ages heard
of any sedition among the Latins, Sabines, Volsci, Equi, Samnites,
and others. The thin, half-starved inhabitants of walls supported by
ivy fear neither popular tumults, nor foreign alarms; and their sleep
is only interrupted by hunger, the cries of their children, or the howling
of wolves. Instead of many turbulent, contentious cities, they
have a few scattered, silent cottages; and the fierceness of those
nations is so tempered, that every rascally collector of taxes extorts,
without fear, from every man, that which should be the nourishment
of his family. And if any of those countries are free from these pernicious
vermin, it is through the extremity of their poverty.’</p>

<p class='c011'>[How differently do people see things! According to Mr.
Malthus, this rascally tax-gatherer, this vile nuisance, is a very
sacred sort of character, a privileged person, one of the most indispensable
and active instruments in the procession of vice and
misery, those harbingers of human happiness; and all our reproaches
and indignation should fall on the poor peasant, for bringing beings
into the world whom he could not maintain, in ‘the face of the
clearest warning, and in defiance of the express command of God,’
as proved by the tax-book. Our superficial politician was not aware
(Mr. Malthus tells us that first appearances are very deceitful) that
the produce of the husbandman’s labour was much better employed
in supporting the waste and extravagance of the rich, than in affording
nourishment to his family, as this would only enable him to <em>rear</em>
his family, which must operate as an encouragement to marriage,
and this again would produce other marriages, and so on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>,
to which unrestricted increase of population it is necessary to put a
timely stop.]</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Even in Rome a man may be circumvented by the fraud of a
priest, or poisoned by one, who would have his estate, wife, whore,
or child; but nothing is done that looks like violence or tumult.
The governors do as little fear Gracchus as Hannibal; and instead
of wearying their subjects in wars,’ [We have not yet reached this
pitch of perfection] ‘they only seek by perverted laws, corrupt
judges, false witnesses, and vexatious suits, to cheat them of their
money and inheritance. This is the best part of their condition.
Where these arts are used, there are men, and they have something
to lose; but for the most part, the lands lie waste; and they who
were formerly troubled with the disorders incident to populous cities,
now enjoy the quiet and peaceable estate of a wilderness.—Again,
there is a way of killing worse than that of the sword; for as
Tertullian says upon a different occasion, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vetare nasci est interficere</span></i>;
those governments are in the highest degree guilty of blood, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>by taking from men the means of living, bring some to perish through
want, drive others out of the country, and generally dissuade men
from marriage, <em>by taking from them all ways of supporting their families</em>.’
[Our author, we see, has not here put the cart before the horse. He
seems to have understood the necessity of food to population, though
Mr. Malthus’s essay had not then been heard of.] ‘Notwithstanding
all the seditions of Florence, and other cities of Tuscany, the horrid
factions of Guelphs and Gibelines,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Neri and Bianchi, nobles and
commons, they continued populous, strong, and exceeding rich; but
in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years, the peaceable reign
of the Medici is thought to have destroyed nine parts in ten of the
people of that province. Among other things it is remarkable, that
when Philip the second of Spain gave Sienna to the Duke of
Florence, his embassador then at Rome sent him word, that he had
given away more than six hundred and fifty thousand subjects; and
it is not believed there are now twenty thousand souls inhabiting that
city and territory. Pisa, Pistoia, Arezzo, Cortona, and other towns,
that were then good and populous, are in the like proportion
diminished, and Florence more than any. When that city had been
long troubled with seditions, tumults, and wars, for the most part
unprosperous, it still retained such strength, that when Charles the
eighth of France, being admitted as a friend with his whole army,
which soon after conquered the kingdom of Naples, thought to
master them, the people, taking up arms, struck such a terror into
him, that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought
fit to impose. Machiavel reports, that in the year 1298 Florence
alone, with the Val d’Arno, a small territory belonging to that city,
could, in a few hours, by the sound of a bell, bring together a
hundred thousand well-armed men. Whereas now that city, with
all the others in that province, are brought to such despicable weakness,
emptiness, poverty, and baseness, that they can neither resist
the oppressions of their own prince, nor defend him or themselves,
if they were assaulted by a foreign enemy. The people are dispersed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>or destroyed, and the best families sent to seek habitations in Venice,
Genoa, Rome, and Lucca. This is not the effect of war or pestilence:
they enjoy a perfect peace, and suffer no other plague than the government
they are under. But he who has thus cured them of disorders
and tumults does in my opinion deserve no greater praise than a
physician, who should boast there was not a sick person in a house
committed to his care, when he had poisoned all that were in it.
The Spaniards have established the like peace in the kingdoms of
Naples and Sicily, the West Indies, and other places. The Turks
by the same means prevent tumults in their dominions. And they
are of such efficacy in all places, that Mario Chigi, brother to pope
Alexander the seventh, by one sordid cheat upon the sale of corn,
is said within eight years to have destroyed above a third part of the
people in the ecclesiastical state. And that country, which was
the strength of the Romans in the time of the Carthaginian wars,
suffered more by the covetousness and fraud of that villain, than
by all the defeats received from Hannibal, &amp;c. Chap. ii. p. 223.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be worth the reader’s while to turn to Lord Kaims’s
account of the kingdom of Siam, which, though one of the most
fertile countries in the world, is reduced to the lowest state of
poverty and wretchedness by the absurd and tyrannical policy of its
government. Some of the finest districts that were formerly cultivated,
are now inhabited only by wild beasts. One of the arts by which
they preserve the balance of population in that country is, that the
keeper of the king’s menagerie is authorized to let loose the elephants
into the gardens of all those within a given distance of the capital,
who do not pay him a large fine yearly to be excused from this
intrusion. Yet according to our Essayist, human institutions have
a very slight influence on the happiness of a people, because they
cannot alter the necessary ratios of the increase of food and population.
It is probable, however, that some of the cases here cited, which
seem to bear rather hard on Mr. Malthus’s rule, might have led those
hasty writers, whom he censures for their want of a due insight into
the subject, to conceive an unjust prejudice against human institutions;
and perhaps some of my readers may also be led to suspect, from not
comprehending fully the scope and connection of his arguments, that
bad governments are not quite such innocent things, as Mr. Malthus
would sometimes represent them. Is it necessary to press this subject
any farther? I do not pretend to be very deep-read in history, in
the constitution of states, the principles of legislation, the progress of
manners, or the immediate causes of the revolutions that have taken
place in different countries. All that I can presume to bring to this
question is a little stubborn common sense, an earnestness of feeling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and a certain familiarity with abstruse subjects, that is not willingly
or easily made the dupe of flimsy distinctions. But without much
learning in one’s self, it is easy to take advantage of the learning of
others. By the help of a common-place book, which is all that is
wanted in these cases (and I am fortunate enough to have such a one
by me in the collections of ‘that honest chronicler,’ James Burgh) I
might soon swell the size of these letters to a bulk, which the bookseller
would not like, by a number of striking illustrations from the
most celebrated authors. I might make myself a splendid livery of
the wisdom of others. But I have no taste for this pompous drudgery.
However, to satisfy those readers who are unable to discern the
truth without the spectacles of facts, it will not be amiss to refer to
the opinions of a few of the writers, who seem with sufficient clearness
to have traced the causes of the rise and fall of particular states
to principles quite independent of, which were neither first set in
motion nor afterwards regulated by the principle of population, and
the effects of which were utterly disproportionate to the actual
operation of that principle. After all, it is impossible to answer a
paradox satisfactorily. The real answer consists of the feelings and
observations of our whole lives; and of course, it must be impossible
to embody these in any single statement. All that can be done in
these cases is to set the imagination once more in its old track.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hear,’ says my authority, ‘the excellent Montague on the
prevalence of luxury among the Romans.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If we connect the various strokes interspersed through what we
have remaining of the writings of Sallust, which were levelled at the
vices of his countrymen, we shall be able to form a just idea of
the manners of the Romans in his time. From this picture, we must
be convinced, that not only those shocking calamities, which the
republic suffered during the contest between Marius and Sylla, but
those subsequent and more fatal evils, which brought on the utter
extinction of the Roman liberty and constitution, were the natural
effects of that foreign luxury, which first introduced venality and
corruption.’ [Now by <em>luxury</em> we may understand a very great
superabundance of the good things of this life, either in the community
at large or in certain classes of it, but it cannot by any
construction be made to signify the general and absolute want of
them. Luxury in some classes may produce want in others, but
poverty is in this case the effect of the unequal distribution of the
produce of the earth, not of its real deficiency. Or if by luxury
we understand only certain exterior decorations or artificial indulgences,
which have nothing to do with the real support of life, such
as dress, furniture, buildings, pictures, gold and silver, rarities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>delicacies of all kinds, every thing connected with shew and expence
(though all these things among the Romans being the effects not
merely of leisure or of supernumerary hands, but of <em>power</em>, and foreign
dominion, must imply a command over the more substantial necessaries
of life) yet even in this sense the passion for luxury or for those
indulgences (which is here said to have been one great instrument in
the overthrow of the state) is certainly a very different thing from
the passion of hunger, or want of food, Mr. Malthus’s key to the
solution of all problems of a political nature.] ‘Though the introduction
of luxury from Asia preceded the ruin of Carthage in point
of time, yet as Sallust informs us, the dread of that dangerous rival
restrained the Romans within the bounds of decency and order.
But as soon as ever <em>that obstacle was removed</em>, they gave a full scope
to their ungoverned passions. The change in their manners was not
gradual, and by little and little as before, but rapid and instantaneous.
Religion, justice, modesty, decency, all regard for divine or human
laws, were swept away at once by the irresistible torrent of corruption.
The nobility strained their privileges, and the people their liberty,
alike into the most unbounded licentiousness. Every one made the
dictate of his own will, his only rule of action. Public virtue, and
the love of their country, which had raised the Romans to the empire
of the universe, were extinct. Money, which alone could enable
them to gratify their darling luxury, was substituted in its place.
Power, dominion, honours, and universal respect were annexed to
the possession of money. Contempt, and whatever was the most
reproachful was the bitter portion of poverty; and to be poor, grew
to be the greatest of all crimes, in the estimation of the Romans.
Thus wealth and poverty contributed alike to the ruin of the republic.
The rich employed their wealth in the acquisition of power, and their
power in every kind of oppression and rapine for the acquisition of
more wealth. The poor, now dissolute and desperate, were ready to
engage in every seditious insurrection, which promised them the
plunder of the rich, and set up both their liberty and country to sale,
to the best bidder. The republic, which was the common prey
to both, was thus rent to pieces between the contending factions.—A
state so circumstanced must always furnish an ample supply of proper
instruments for faction. For as luxury consists in an inordinate
gratification of the sensual passions, and as the more they are indulged,
the more importunate they grow, the greatest fortune must at last
sink under their insatiable demands. Thus luxury necessarily produces
corruption. As wealth is necessary to the support of luxury,
all those who have dissipated their private fortunes in the purchase of
pleasure, will be ever ready to enlist in the cause of faction for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>wages of corruption. And when once the idea of respect and
homage is annexed to the possession of wealth alone, honour, probity,
every virtue and every amiable quality will be held cheap in comparison
and looked upon as awkward, and quite unfashionable. But
as the spirit of liberty will yet exist in some degree, in a state which
retains the name of freedom, even though the manners of that state
should be generally depraved, an opposition will arise from those
virtuous citizens, who know the value of their birth-right, liberty, and
who will not submit tamely to the chains of faction. Force will
then be called in to the aid of corruption, a military government will
be established on the ruins of the civil, and all commands and
employments will be at the disposal of arbitrary, lawless power.
The people will be fleeced to pay for their own fetters, and doomed,
like the cattle, to unremitting toil and drudgery, for the support of
their tyrannical masters.’ [All this is evidently erroneous, when we
apply to it the touch-stone of the theory of population. The people
are not fleeced and worked in this manner for the benefit of those
who fleece and work them, to gratify any appetites or passions of
theirs, it is out of pure good-will to the poor wretches themselves,
that they may live more at their ease, and in a greater degree of
affluence than they would without this timely warning of the evils of
poverty.] ‘Or if the outward form of civil government should be
permitted to remain, the people will be compelled to give a sanction
to tyranny by their own suffrages, and to elect oppressors instead of
protectors.—From this genuine portrait of the Roman state it is
evident that the fatal catastrophe of that republic, of which Sallust
himself was an eye-witness, was the natural effect of the corruption
of their manners; and again, that this corruption was the effect
of the introduction of foreign wealth and luxury. This fatal
tendency was too obvious to escape the notice of those who had
any regard for liberty and their ancient constitution. Many sumptuary
laws were made to restrain the excesses of luxury; but these
efforts were too feeble to check the over-bearing violence of the
torrent. Cato proposed a severe law, enforced by the sanction of an
oath, against bribery and corruption at elections; where the scandalous
traffic of votes was established by custom, as at a public market.
But he only incurred the resentment of both parties by that salutary
measure. The rich, who had no other merit to plead but what
arose from their superior wealth, thus found themselves precluded
from all pretensions to the highest dignities. The electors abused,
cursed and even pelted him as the author of a law which reduced
them to the necessity of subsisting by labour. Corruption was
arrived at its height, and those excesses which were formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>esteemed the <em>vices</em> of the people were now, by the force of custom,
become the <em>manners</em> of the people. To pilfer the public money and
to plunder the provinces by violence, though state crimes of the most
heinous nature, were grown so familiar, that they were looked upon
as no more than mere office perquisites.’ Really I am afraid that
the reader will suspect me of falsifying the historical record to
write a satire against our own times. Some of these remarks are I
confess <em>home</em> truths. To a person who has not that mysterious kind
of penetration which the author of the Essay possesses, they carry
more weight, and give a clearer insight into the principles that
operate in the decomposition of states, than all Mr. Malthus’s indiscriminate
and shadowy reasonings on the evils of population,
which can no more prove anything decisively on the subject, than we
can account for the inequalities in the surface of the earth from its
being round.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same author adds, ‘Though there is a concurrence of several
causes in the ruin of a state, yet where luxury prevails, that parent of
all our fantastic wants, ever craving, and ever unsatisfied, we may
safely assign it as the leading cause; since it ever was and ever will be
the most baneful to public virtue. <em>As luxury is contagious from its
very nature</em>, it will gradually descend from the highest to the lowest
ranks till it has ultimately affected a whole people.—We see luxury
gradually increasing and prevailing over the Roman spirit and virtue,
till at length the contagion <em>even</em> reached ladies of the greatest distinction,
who in imitation of the prince and his court, had their
assemblies and representations in a grove, planted by the Emperor,
where booths were built, and in them sold whatever incited to
sensuality and wantonness. Thus was even the outward appearance
of virtue banished the city, and all manner of avowed lewdness,
depravity and dissoluteness introduced in its room, men and women
being engaged in a contention to outvie each other in glaring vices,
and scenes of impurity. Again.—About the time that the Roman
republic was tottering to its fall, it was observed that there was an
universal degeneracy of manners prevailing, particularly that the
women were very scandalous in their behaviour at Rome, while those of
the countries called by them barbarous were remarkably exemplary in this
respect.’ Was this difference wholly owing to the difference in the
state of population? Or shall we believe that the ladies of Roman
knights, that the wives and daughters of Emperors, that the mistresses of
those to whom the world was tributary, who scattered pearls and gold
among their followers, who gave largesses of corn to the people, and
entertained them at ten thousand tables at a time, who ate the tongues of
peacocks and nightingales, and the brains of parrots, whose dogs were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>fed with the livers of geese, their horses with raisins, and their wild
beasts with the flesh of partridges and pheasants, shall we believe
that these delicate creatures, who dreamt of nothing but pleasure and
feasting, who reclined on silken couches, whose baths were made of
rose-water and wine, who scented the air with all the perfumes of the
East, whose rich dresses were upborne by a train of waiting-women,
and idle boys, were driven to the necessity of stimulating their
passions by lewd exhibitions, and wanton dances, and lascivious
songs, and soft music and obscene practices, because they were
hindered from gratifying their honest desires in a lawful way by the
difficulty of providing for their future offspring, or the pressure of
population on the means of subsistence? Yet this is what we must
be led to suppose from Mr. Malthus’s theory, according to whom
vice is the natural consequence of want, and want the effect of
increasing population. For any one who is acquainted with the state
of manners, and the mode of living among the great at Rome at this
time to pretend that all this was owing to nothing but the advanced
state of population, just as the rising or falling of the weather-glass
depends on the pressure of the air outside, betrays a most astonishing
ignorance of human nature. I think I am warranted in laying down
the two following maxims; that luxury is itself an immediate cause of
dissoluteness of manners; secondly, that example, particularly that of
the great, has a powerful influence over manners.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before I quit this subject of Roman luxury, I shall just mention a
fact quoted by my author, which seems to contradict Mr. Malthus’s
notion that the luxuries of the rich do not in the least affect the
condition of the poor. ‘The good Emperor Aurelius,’ says Burgh,
‘sold the plate, furniture, jewels, pictures and statues of the imperial
palace, <em>to relieve the distresses of the people</em>, occasioned by the invasion
of barbarians, pestilence, famine, &amp;c. the value of which was so great,
that it maintained the war for five years, beside other inestimable
expences.’ If according to Mr. Malthus’s reasoning on this subject
in different parts of his work, every man’s stomach can hold only
a certain quantity of food, and what does not go into one man’s
stomach necessarily goes into some other’s, that is, if every person
has as large a share as it is possible he should have of the necessaries
of life, I do not see what this moving of pictures or statues about, or
setting them up to auction should have to do with the state of
provisions, or how it should relieve the necessities of the poor.
Mr. Malthus’s reasonings are sometimes as remarkable for their
simplicity as they are at others for their complexity. He sees things
in the most natural or in the most artificial point of view, as he
pleases. At one time, every thing comes round by a labyrinth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>causes, and all the intricate secretions of the state; at another time
the whole science of political economy is reduced to a flat calculation
of the size of a quartern loaf, and the size of the human stomach.</p>

<p class='c011'>All authors (but Mr. Malthus) seem agreed that luxury has been
fatal to the spirit of liberty, and that the loss of liberty has led to the
loss of independence. ‘The welfare of every country depends upon
the morals of the people. Though a nation may become rich by
trade, thrift, and industry, or from the advantages of soil and
situation, or may attain to great eminence and power either by
force of arms, or by the sagacity of their councils; yet when their
manners are depraved, they will decline insensibly, and at last come
to utter destruction. When a country is grown vicious, industry
decays, and the people become unruly, effeminate, and unfit for
labour. Luxury, when introduced into free states, and suffered to
spread through the body of the people was ever productive of that
degeneracy of manners, which extinguishes public virtue, and puts a
final period to liberty. Thus the Assyrian empire sunk under the
arms of Cyrus with his poor but hardy Persians. The extensive and
opulent empire of Persia fell an easy prey to Alexander and a handful
of Macedonians. And the Macedonian empire, when enervated by
the luxury of Asia, was compelled to receive the yoke of the victorious
Romans. The descendants of the heroes, philosophers, orators, and
free citizens of Greece are now the slaves of the Grand Turk.
The posterity of the Scipios and Catos of Rome are now singing
operas, in the shape of Italian eunuchs, on the English stage.’<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> It
should seem from the length of time which these countries have
remained in the same degraded condition without a single effort or
even wish to relieve themselves from it, that there must be other
causes of the permanent depression of states, and other channels of
transmission, by which the habits, and characters of the people, their
customs and institutions, are handed down through successive generations
without any hope of a change for the better, besides the
mechanical fluctuations in the principle of population. If all laws,
institutions, manners, and customs were only so many <em>expressions</em> (as
I may say) of the power of that principle, kingdoms would rise and
fall with the operation of the checks provided for it; their alternate
renovation and decay would be as regular as the ebbing and flowing
of the tide; in proportion as they sank deep in wretchedness, they
would tower to greater happiness and splendour; the foundation of
their future prosperity would be laid in the lowness of their fortune;
the exhausted state would rise, like the phœnix, out of its own ashes,
and enter the career of liberty and glory in all its pristine vigour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>But we do not find that the accounts in history correspond with the
oscillations of Mr. Malthus’s theory. We find through a long,
dreary tract of time, during which our author’s ratios must have been
ascending and descending like buckets in a well, that the inhabitants
of those devoted countries have remained just where they were,—in
the lowest scale of human being. They have for a great many
hundred years been undergoing the wholesome discipline of vice and
misery without being the better for it, the iron yoke of necessity to
which they have so long and patiently submitted does not seem ever
to have been relaxed in their favour, and they have reaped none of
those reversionary benefits which might be expected from slavery and
famine. These powerful principles have not done much to rekindle
in their breasts their ancient love of liberty, the glow of genius,—or
to open a new field for the rapid increase of population. They have
not been favoured with any of those <em>ups</em> and <em>downs</em>, those pretty
whirls and agreeable vicissitudes of good and evil, which Mr. Malthus
describes as the natural consequence of the principles on which his
machine of population is constructed. This is a radical objection to
his machine; it shews plainly that it is not constructed on true
principles, that we cannot safely trust ourselves in it, and will I hope
deter us from getting up into it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Swiss keep the same unchanged character of simplicity,
honesty, frugality, modesty, bravery. These are the virtues which
preserve liberty. They have no corrupt court, no blood-sucking
placemen, no standing army, the ready instruments of tyranny, no
ambition for conquest, no debauching commerce, no luxury, no
citadels against invasions and against liberty. Their mountains are
their fortifications, and every householder is a soldier, ready to fight
for his country.’ This is the account which Voltaire gives of that
country. Since that time, it has fallen by a power greater than its
own, and paid with its liberty for the folly and madness of the rest of
Europe. I hope I shall not offend any of the sycophants of power,
any of the enlightened patriots of the day who regard the general
distinctions of liberty and slavery as slight and evanescent, by adding
to my list of political grievances foreign conquest as an evil, and an
evil that tends to no certain good.—I would fain know from the
adepts in the science of population whether according to that system
it would be an advantage to this country to be conquered by the
French. The necessary ratios of the increase of food and population
(which according to our author are every thing,—he utterly rejects
the idea that established governments can do any mischief) would of
course remain the same; and as to the practical part, population
would, if any thing, go on slower than before. I cannot but think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>however that most of my readers would in such a case anticipate the
consequences which our political reformer describes in his croaking
old-fashioned way as proceeding from another cause, the corruption
of the people, and the abuses of government at home. ‘I see’ he
says, ‘my wretched country in the same condition as France is now.’
[This was written at a time when it was the fashion for the English
to reproach all other countries for their misery and slavery, as they
have since been in the habit of hunting them down for their attempts
at liberty.] ‘Instead of the rich and thriving farmers, who now fill
or who lately filled, the country with agriculture, yielding plenty for
man and beast, I see the lands neglected, the villages and farms in
ruins, with here and there a starveling in wooden shoes, driving his
plough, his team consisting of an old goat, a hide-bound bullock, and
an ass, value in all forty shillings. I see the once rich and populous
cities of England in the same condition with those of Spain; whole
streets lying in rubbish, and the grass peeping out between the stones
in those which continue still inhabited. I see the harbours empty,
the warehouses shut up, and the shop-keepers playing at draughts, for
want of customers. I see our noble and spacious turnpike roads
covered with thistles and other weeds, and hardly to be traced out.
I see the studious men reading the Political Disquisitions, and the
histories of the eighteenth century, and execrating the stupidity of
their fathers, who in spite of the many faithful warnings given them,
sat still, and suffered their country to be ruined by a set of wretches,
whom they could have crushed. I see the country devoured by an
army of 200,000 men. I see justice trodden under foot in the
courts of justice. I see <cite>Magna Charta</cite>, the <cite>Habeas Corpus</cite> act, the
bill of rights, and trial by jury, obsolete, and royal edicts and <em>arrets</em>
set up in their place. I see the once respectable land-owners,
tradesmen, and manufacturers of England sunk into contempt, and
placemen and military officers the only persons of consequence, &amp;c.’
I do not know but there may be some staunch adherents to the new
philosophy, some hyper-graduates in the school, who would think
such a state of things ‘a consummation devoutly to be wished.’ But
it is happy that where our reason leaves us, our prejudices often come
to our aid. Though there may be some persons in this country who
would not care a fig for the Bastile, or letters <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de cachet</span></i>, there is no
one who has not a just dread of Buonaparte; or who would not
indignantly spurn at the wretch who told him that so long as the
disproportion in the increase of food and the increase of mankind
continued, it was of little consequence to him whether he was subject
to the yoke of a foreign tyrant, or governed by a mild and lawful
sovereign.—It has always been the custom for the English to extol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>themselves to the skies as the freest and happiest nation on the face
of the earth. Ever since I was a boy, I remember to have heard
of the trial by jury, Magna Charta, and the bill of rights, of the
Bastile in France, and the Inquisition in Spain, and the man in the
Iron mask. Now whether it is that I was a boy when I first
heard of these things, or that they carry some weight and meaning in
themselves, certain it is that they have made such a strong and
indelible impression on my mind as totally to preclude the effects
of Mr. Malthus’s philosophy. Whether it is owing to the strength
of my reason or my prejudices, I cannot receive the benefit of his
new light. As these are some of the strongest feelings I have,
(though they may perhaps be just as childish as those which I still
have in reading the story of Goody Two-Shoes, or the Little Red
Riding-hood) it occurred to me to make some use of them in answer
to Mr. Malthus’s challenge to shew that there is no difference
between one government and another in the essentials of liberty and
happiness. Or I thought I might contrast the constitution of this
country with that of Denmark, where (says Lord Molesworth) the
peasants are as absolute slaves as the negroes in Jamaica, and <em>worse
fed</em>. This seemed to be strong ground. But then I recollected
that the very same expression had been applied by a person, whom
it would be unbecoming in me to contradict, to the peasants in this
country.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> I also met with a passage something to the same purpose
in the Political Disquisitions, which a little damped my patriotic
eagerness. ‘A poor hard-working man, who has a wife and six
children to maintain’ [what a wicked wretch!] ‘can neither enjoy
the glorious light of heaven, nor the glimmering of a farthing candle,
without paying the window tax and the candle tax. He rises early
and sits up late; he fills the whole day with severe labour; he goes
to his flock-bed with half a belly-full of bread and cheese denying
the call of natural appetite, that his wife and little starvelings may
have the more.’ [Why he is very justly punished to be sure. True;
but mark the sequel.] ‘In the mean while the exactors of these
taxes are revelling at the expence of more money for one evening’s
amusement, than the wretched hard-working man (who is obliged
to find the money for them to squander) can earn by half a year’s
severe labour.’ On the whole, I was obliged to relinquish my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>project. I found that my picture must either want effect, or be out
of all keeping. And besides the relations of things had not only
changed, but men’s opinions had changed with them. An overcharged
description of English liberty and continental slavery would
not be at all to the taste of the times. It would sound like mere
rant, and would come to nothing. But when I came to that fine
representation of the effects of slavery, which Burgh has left us,
with those exquisite figures of the old goat, the bullock and the
ass, and the group of shop-keepers playing at draughts for want of
something to do, I was determined to bring it in, cost what it would.
At last, I bethought me of the expedient of an invasion,—at that
word I knew that every true friend of his country would grow pale,
would see the odious consequences of slavery in their native deformity,
and turn with disdain from those vile panders to vice and misery,
those sanguine enthusiasts of mischief, who would artfully reconcile
them to every species of want, oppression, and unfeeling barbarity,
as the necessary consequences of the principle of population. So
much more credit do we attach to names, than things!—The whole
of the account of Denmark to which I have just referred, is well
worthy of attention: I cannot forbear giving the following extract.
‘The consequence of this oppression is that the people of Denmark
finding it impossible to secure their property’ [from the tax-gatherers]
‘squander their little gettings, as fast as they can, and are irremediably
poor. Oppression and arbitrary sway beget distrust and doubts about
the security of property; doubts beget profusion, men chusing to
squander on their pleasures what they apprehend may excite the
rapaciousness of their superiors; and this profusion is the legitimate
parent of that universal indolence, poverty and despondency, which
so strongly characterize the miserable inhabitants of Denmark. When
Lord Molesworth resided in that country, the collectors of the poll-tax
were obliged to accept of old feather-beds, brass and pewter pans,
&amp;c. instead of money, from the inhabitants of a town, which once
raised 200,000 rix dollars for Christiern IV. on twenty-four hours’
notice. The quartering and paying the king’s troops is another
grievance no less oppressive. The boors are obliged to furnish the
king and every little insolent courtier with horses and waggons in
their journeys, and are beaten like cattle. Consequently, Denmark,
once very populous, is become thin of inhabitants; as poverty, oppression,
and meagre diet do miserably check procreation, besides producing
diseases which shorten the lives of the few who are born.’
[How miserably short-sighted must our author have been not to
perceive that these were great advantages!] ‘All this the rich and
thriving and free people of England may bring themselves to, if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>please’ [by following up Mr. Malthus’s theory.] ‘It is only letting
the court go on with their scheme of diffusing universal corruption
through all ranks, and it will come of course.’—There is one passage
in this account, which malevolence itself cannot apply to the history
of this country. ‘Before the government of Denmark was made
hereditary and absolute in the present royal family, by that fatal
measure in 1660, the nobility lived in great splendour and affluence.
<em>Now they are poor and their number diminished.</em>’</p>

<p class='c011'>I shall conclude these extracts with the following passages, taken
at random, which will at least serve to shew the strange prejudices
that prevailed on the subject, before Mr. Malthus, like the clown in
Shakespear, undertook to find out an answer that should explain all
difficulties. ‘It must indeed be an answer of most monstrous size
that fits all demands.’ But perhaps Mr. Malthus is by this time convinced,
that ‘a thing may serve long, and not serve ever.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The richest soil in Europe, Italy, is full of beggars; among the
Grisons, the poorest country in Europe, there are no beggars. The
bailage of Lugane is the worst country, the least productive, the most
exposed to cold and the least capable of trade of any in all Italy, and
yet is the best peopled. If ever this country is brought under a yoke
like that which the rest of Italy bears, it will soon be abandoned, for
nothing draws so many people to live in so bad a soil, when they are
in sight of the best soil in Europe, but the easiness of the government.’
Burnet’s Travels.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Italy shews, in a very striking light, the advantages of free
government.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The subjects of the Italian republics are thriving and
happy. Those under the Pope, the dukes of Tuscany, Florence
&amp;c. wretched in the extreme.—Lucca, to mention no other, is a
remarkable instance of the happy effects of liberty. The whole
dominion is but thirty miles round, yet contains, besides the city,
150 villages, 120,000 inhabitants, and all the soil is cultivated to
the utmost. Their magistrates are re-elected every two months out
of a body of nobility, who are chosen every two years.’ Modern
Universal History. See also A. Sydney as before quoted.—These
differences cannot be accounted for by the length of time or the
force with which the principle of population has operated in these
states. The countries are equally old, and the climate very nearly
the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In England an industrious subject has the best chance for
thriving, because the country is the freest. In the Mogul’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>dominions the worst, because the country is the most effectually
enslaved.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The title of freemen was formerly confined chiefly to the nobility
and gentry, who were descended of free ancestors. <em>For the greatest
part of the people</em> was restrained under some species of slavery, so that
they were not their own masters.’ Spelman’s Glossary.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a>—On this
passage my author remarks very gravely, ‘What has been in England
may be again. If liberty be on the decline, no one knows how low
it may sink, and to what pitch of slavery and cruelty it may grow.’
Mr. Malthus’s theory tends to familiarise the mind to such a change
as the necessary effect of the progress of population. But this pretext
is here clearly done away, as we have fought up to our present free,
and flourishing state, in the <em>teeth</em> of this principle. Our progress has
not been uniformly <em>retrograde</em>, as it ought to have been to make any
thing of the argument.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is constantly (said a member in Queen Elizabeth’s time)
in the mouths of us all, that our lands, goods and laws are at our
prince’s disposal.’ We do not at present come <em>quite</em> up to the loyalty
of this speaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nations have often been deceived into slavery by men of shining
abilities.’ Perhaps the late Mr. Burke was an instance of this. I
by no means insist that he was, because there may be differences
of opinion on that point. But of this I am sure, that the effect
of his writings, good or bad, cannot be measured—by the principle of
population.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A single genius changes the face and state of a whole country, as
Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and Peter the great of Russia.
Confucius produced a reformation in one of the oriental kingdoms in
a few months.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Commerce introduced by the czar Peter introduced luxury.
Universal dissipation took the lead, and profligacy of manners
succeeded. <em>Many of the lords began to squeeze and grind the peasants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to extort fresh supplies from them for the incessant demands of luxury</em>’—not
of population.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The extreme poverty occasioned by idleness and luxury in the
beginning of Lewis <span class='fss'>XIII.</span> of France filled the streets of Paris with
beggars. The court disgusted at the sight, which indeed was a
severe reproach on them, issued an order, forbidding all persons, on
severe penalties, to relieve them, intending thereby to drive them out
of the town, and not caring though they dropped down dead, before
they could reach the country towns and villages.’ This was a project
worthy of the genius of Mr. Malthus.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Government, according to Plato, is the parent of manners. One
judicious regulation will often produce a very salutary effect on a
whole people, as experimental philosophy shews us, that a wire will
secure a castle from the once irresistible force of lightning.—Mankind
may be brought to hold any principles and to indulge any practices,
and again to give them up.—Is there any notion of right and wrong,
about which mankind are universally agreed? Is it not evident that
mankind may be moulded into any shape? How come we to know
that antimony or quicksilver may, by chemical processes, be made to
pass through twenty different states, and restored again to their original
state? Is it not by experiment? Are not the various legislations,
institutions, regulations of wise or designing statesmen, priests, and
kings, a series of experiments, shewing that human nature is susceptible
of any form or character?’ According to the most modern discovery,
these things never did, nor ever will have any effect at all. The
question is simply whether the state of food and the state of population
being the same, the different causes here alluded to have not
produced very different results with respect to the degree both of vice
and misery existing in the world.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>‘The great difference we see between the behaviour of the people
called Quakers, and all others; between English, Scotch, Irish,
French, Spanish, Heathens, Mahometan, Christian, Popish, Protestant
manners and characters, &amp;c. the regular and permanent difference
we see between the manners of all these divisions of mankind, shews
beyond all doubt that the principles and habits of the people are very
much in the power of able statesmen.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Among the Lacedemonians there was no such crime as infidelity to
the marriage-bed: yet Lycurgus in framing his laws had used no precaution
against it, but the virtuous and temperate education he prescribed
for the youth of both sexes.—The influence which education has on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the manners of a people is so considerable that it cannot be estimated.
But by <em>education</em> it is to be observed, we must understand not only
what is taught at schools and universities, but the impressions young
people receive from parents, and from the world, which greatly outweigh
all that can be done by masters and tutors. Education, taken
in this enlarged sense, is almost all that makes the difference between
the characters of nations; and it is a severe satire on our times, <em>that
the world makes most young men very different beings from what those
who educated them intended them to be</em>.’ This last remark is I think
of the utmost force and importance; and has never been sufficiently
attended to by those who prate most fluently and triumphantly about
the inherent perversity of human nature. A young man is seldom
tainted by the world, till he becomes dependent on it. I have known
several persons who I am sure have set out in life with the utmost
purity of intention, and a noble ingenuousness of mind, and were
prepared to act on very different principles from those, which they
found prevailing in the world. Is the fault in this case in the
wood, or in the carver? Is it in the stuff, or in the mould, in
which it is cast? The difficulty seems to be, how to get a better
mould.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Aristotle lays down very strict rules concerning the company
young people may be allowed to keep, the public diversions they may
attend; the pictures they may see, and against obscenity, intemperance,
&amp;c. And the eighth book of his politics is employed wholly on
education, in which he shews, that youth ought to be strongly
impressed with the idea of their being members of a community,
whose good they are to prefer to their private advantage in all cases
where they come in competition. He commends the wisdom of the
Spartans in paying such attention to this great object. Such is the
delicacy of this old Heathen, that he hesitates about the propriety of
young men’s applying to music, as being likely to enervate the mind.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Lycurgus did not allow the Spartans to travel, lest they should
be tainted by the manners of other nations.’ I do not chuse to name
all the vices that have been imported into this country within the last
fifty years by the aid of foreign travel. Vice is unfortunately of a
very tenacious quality, and there is no quarantine against the epidemics
of the mind. In return, however, we have learned to converse, to
dress, and dance better than we used to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘At Sparta, the poets could not publish any thing without a license;
and all immoral writings were prohibited. A very wise man<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> said
he believed, if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need
not care who made the laws of a nation. The ancient legislators did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>not pretend to reform the manners of the people without the help of
the poets.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The grave Romans did not allow a person of character to dance!
It was a saying among them, no one dances unless he is drunk or mad.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In the old English laws, we find punishments for wanton behaviour,
as touching the breasts of women, &amp;c.—By the ancient laws of
France, the least indecency of behaviour to a free woman, as squeezing
the hand, touching the arm or breast, &amp;c. was punishable by fire.’<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
What odd, sour, crabbed notions must have prevailed in those days!
Not squeeze a lady’s hand! No—a much more agreeable latitude of
behaviour is allowed at present: we are as much improved in our
notions of gallantry as of liberty. The polite reader will not suspect
me of a design to hold up the shocking manners of our ancestors as
models of imitation in the present day; I only mention them to shew
what a wide difference there may be in the notions of decency and
propriety at different times!</p>

<p class='c011'>If a stranger, on entering a large town, London for example,
should be struck with that immense number of prostitutes, ‘who elbow
us aside in all our crowded streets,’ and not well knowing how to
account for this enormous abuse, should apply to a disciple of the
modern school for some explanation of it, he would probably be told
with great gravity, <em>That it was a necessary consequence of the progress
of population, and the superior power of that principle over the increase in
the means of subsistence</em>.—If Mr. Malthus, contented to follow in the
track of common sense, and not smitten with the love of dangerous
novelty, had endeavoured to trace the torrent of vice and dissipation
which threatens to bear down every principle of virtue and decency
among us to the chief sources pointed out by other writers, to the
particular institutions of society, to the prevalence of luxury, the
inequality of conditions, the facility of gratifying the passions from
the power of offering temptation, and inducements to accept it, the
disproportion between the passions excited in individuals, and their
situation in life, to books, to education, the progress of arts, the
influence of neighbouring example, &amp;c. these are all causes, which, as
they are arbitrary and variable, seem as if they could be counteracted
or modified by other causes; they are the work of man, and what is
the work of man it seems in the power of man to confirm or alter.
We see distinctly the source of the grievance, and try to remedy it:
hope remains, the will acts with double energy, the spirit of virtue is
not broken. Our vices grow out of other vices, out of our own
passions, prejudices, folly, and weakness: there is nothing in this to
make us proud of them, or to reconcile us to them; even though we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>may despair, we are not confounded. We still have the theory of
virtue left: we are not obliged to give up the distinction between good
and evil even in imagination: there is some little good which we
may at least wish to do. Man in this case retains the character of
a free agent; he stands chargeable with his own conduct, and a sense
of the consequences of his own presumption or blindness may arouse in
him feelings that may in some measure counteract their worst effects;
he may regret what he cannot help: the life, the pulse, the spring of
morality is not dead in him; his moral sense is not quite extinguished.
But our author has chosen to stagger the minds of his readers by
representing vice and misery as the necessary consequences of an
abstract principle, of a fundamental law of our nature, on which
nothing can be effected by the human will. This principle follows
us wherever we go; if we fly into the uttermost parts of the earth,
it is there: whether we turn to the right or the left, we cannot
escape from it. O rather for that warning voice, that once cried
aloud, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Insensés qui vous plaignez, sans cesse de la nature, apprenez que
tous vos maux vous viennent de vous!</span></i> As however I deny the
sufficiency of our author’s all-pervading principle, I may be required
to point out more particularly what I conceive to be the real and
determining causes of the decay of manners. I do not know that I
can mention any that do not come under the heads already alluded
to, but if I must give a short answer, I should say,—Great towns,
great schools, dress, and novels. These things are not regulated
exactly by the size of the earth, and yet must be allowed to have
some influence on manners. To instance only the two last. Is
it to be wondered at that a young raw ignorant girl, who is sent up
from the country as a milliner’s or mantua-maker’s apprentice, and
stowed into a room with eight or ten others, who snatch every
moment they can spare from caps and bonnets, and sit up half the
night to read all the novels they can get, and as soon they have
finished one, send for another, whose heart, in the course of half a
year, has been pierced through with twenty beaux on paper, who has
been courted, seduced, run away with, married and put to bed under
all the fine names that the imagination can invent to as many fine
gentlemen, who has sighed and wept with so many heroes and
heroines that her tears and sighs have at last caused in her a defluction
of the brain, and a palpitation of the heart at the sight of every man,
whose fancy is love-sick, and her head quite turned, should be unable
to resist the first coxcomb of real flesh and blood, who in shining
boots and a velvet collar accosts her in the shape of a lover, but who
has no thoughts of marrying her, because if he were to take this
imprudent step, he must give up his shining boots and velvet collar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and the respect they procure him in the world? Zaleucus ordained
that no woman should dress herself gorgeously, unless she was a
prostitute. If I were a law-giver, and chose to meddle in such
matters, I would ordain that no woman should expose her shape
publicly, unless she were a prostitute.—The female form is more
proper for child-bearing, than for public exhibition; this secret
analogy, when coupled with modesty and reserve, is however its
greatest charm. The strange fancy-dresses, the perverse disguises,
the counterfeit shapes, the stiff stays, and enormous hoops worn by
the women in the time of the Spectator gave an agreeable scope to
the imagination. The greedy eye and rash hand of licentiousness
were repressed. The senses were never satisfied in an instant. Love
was entangled in the folds of the swelling handkerchief, and the
desires might wander for ever round the circumference of a quilted
petticoat, or find a rich lodging in the flowers of a damask stomacher.
There was room for years of patient perseverance, for a thousand
thoughts, fancies, conjectures, hopes, fears, and wishes. There
seemed no end to difficulties and delays: to overcome so many
obstacles was the work of ages. A <em>wife</em> had then some meaning in
it: it was an angel concealed behind whalebone, flounces, and brocade.
The transition from a mistress in masquerade to a wife in wedding
sheets was worth venturing for: now it is nothing, and we hear no
more of faithful courtships, and romantic loves. A woman can be
<em>but</em> undressed.—The young ladies we at present see with the thin
muslin vest drawn tight round the slender waist, and following with
nice exactness the undulations of the shape downwards, disclosing
each full swell, each coy recess, obtruding on the eye each opening
charm, the play of the muscles, the working of the thighs, and by the
help of a walk, of which every step seems a gird, and which keeps
the limbs strained to the utmost point, displaying all those graceful
involutions of person, and all those powers of fascinating motion, of
which the female form is susceptible—these moving pictures of lust
and nakedness, against which the greasy imaginations of grooms and
porters may rub themselves, running the gauntlet of the saucy looks
and indecent sarcasms of the boys in the street, staring at every ugly
fellow, leering at every handsome man, and throwing out a lure for
every fool (true Spartan girls, who if they were metamorphosed into
any thing in the manner of Ovid, it would certainly be into valerian!)
are the very same, whose mothers or grand-mothers buried themselves
under a pile of clothes, whose timid steps hardly touched the ground,
whose eyes were constantly averted from the rude gaze of the men,
and who almost blushed at their own shadows. ‘Of such we in
romances read.’ It does not require any great spirit of divination to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>perceive that this change in appearance must imply some change in
manners. Is this change then owing entirely to the increased pressure
of the principle of population, or have not French fashions, French
milliners, and French dancing-masters had some hand in producing
it?<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>—Mr. Malthus inveighs with great severity against squalid
poverty, and the vices produced by filth and rags. I allow the
justice of his remarks, and think that the condition of the poor in this
respect is one of the chief nuisances of society. After giving the
poor a scrubbing with a coarse towel in the manner he has done, it
would not have been amiss if he had taken a clean white clerical
pocket-handkerchief, and applied it to wipe off the rouge from the
cheeks of painted prostitution, or thrown it as a covering over the
polished neck and ivory shoulders of ladies of high quality. The
bishop of London would have praised the attempt. Mr. Malthus
might have distinguished between the involuntary rents, and the
unlucky loop-holes which sometimes appear in a poor girl’s petticoat,
and the elegant dishabille and studied nakedness of high life. The
dirt that sticks to a wench’s face in cleaning a saucepan is I think
likely to have less effect on the character than the red paste daubed
on the cheeks before a looking-glass, to give <em>animation</em> to the eyes.
The contempt which dirt and poverty excite must destroy all moral
sensibility. Must not the glare of fashion and the perpetual intoxication
of personal vanity have the same effect? The poor grovel in
disagreeable sensations, the rich wanton in voluptuous ones. The
passions are not more likely to be inflamed by stale porter, the
screams of a fiddle, and the clattering of a hornpipe at a hop in
St. Giles’s, than by the elegant liqueurs, the soft sounds of the
clarionet and hautboy, and the languishing movements of walses,
allemandes, and minuets <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la cour</span></i> at a ball in St. James’s. A fair,
or an opera may equally turn the head of any silly girl that goes to
one. Of the two, a tune on the salt-box would be got over sooner
than Narcissus and the Graces. The tawdry prints to be seen in
garrets, and the ballads sung at the corners of streets do not much
improve the morals of the people: but I put it to the conscience of
our sentimental divine, whether the Wanton Wife of Bath, or the tall
captain with his arm round the chambermaid’s waist, or Jemmy
Jessamy lolling on the sofa with his mistress, may be expected to
produce more accidents than those luscious collections of the poets, or
those grave scripture-pieces, or classical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> of Venus and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Adonis, of Leda with her Swan, Nymphs, Fawns, and Satyrs,
which gentlemen of fortune keep in their houses for the instruction of
their wives and daughters. Mr. Malthus is convinced that no young
woman brought up in nastiness and vulgarity, however virtuous she
may seem, can be good for any thing at twenty: I confess I have the
same cynical opinion of those, who have the good fortune to be
brought up in the obscene refinements of fashionable life.</p>

<p class='c011'>I never fell in love but once; and then it was with a girl who
always wore her handkerchief pinned tight round her neck, with a
fair face, gentle eyes, a soft smile, and cool auburn locks. I mention
this, because it may in some measure account for my temperate,
tractable notions of this passion, compared with Mr. Malthus’s. It
was not a raging heat, a fever in the veins: but it was like a vision,
a dream, like thoughts of childhood, an everlasting hope, a distant
joy, a heaven, a world that might be. The dream is still left, and
sometimes comes confusedly over me in solitude and silence, and
mingles with the softness of the sky, and veils my eyes from mortal
grossness. After all, Mr. Malthus may be right in his opinion of
human nature. Though my notions of love have been thus aerial and
refined, I do not know that this was any advantage to me, or that I
might not have done better with a few of our author’s ungovernable
transports, and sensual oozings. Perhaps the workings of the heart
are best expressed by a gloating countenance, by mawkish sentiments
and lively gestures. Cupid often perches on broad shoulders, or on
the brawny calf of a leg, a settlement is better than a love-letter, and
in love not minds, but bodies and fortunes meet. I have therefore
half a mind to retract all that I have said, and prove to Mr. Malthus
that love is not even so intellectual a passion as he sometimes admits
it to be, but altogether gross and corporal.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have thus attempted to answer the different points of Mr. Malthus’s
argument, and give a truer account of the various principles that actuate
human nature. There is but one advantage that I can conceive of as
resulting from the admission of his mechanical theory on the subject,
which is that it would be the most effectual recipe for indifference
that has yet been found out. No one need give himself any farther
trouble about the progress of vice, or the extension of misery. The
office of moral censor, that troublesome, uneasy office which every
one is so ready to set up in his own breast, and which I verily believe
is the occasion of more unhappiness than any one cause else, would be
at an end. The professor’s chair of morality would become vacant,
and no one would have more cause than I to rejoice at the breaking
up for the holidays; for I have plagued myself a good deal about the
distinctions of right and wrong. The pilot might let go the helm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and leave the vessel to drift carelessly before the stream. When we
are once convinced that the degree of virtue and happiness can no
more be influenced by human wisdom than the ebbing and flowing of
the tide, it must be idle to give ourselves any more concern about
them. The wise man might then enjoy an Epicurean languor and
repose, without being conscious of the neglect of duty. Mr. Malthus’s
system is one, ‘in which the wicked cease from troubling, and in
which the weary are at rest.’ To persons of an irritable and nervous
disposition, who are fond of kicking against the pricks, who have
tasted of the bitterness of the knowledge of good and evil, and to
whom whatever is amiss in others sticks not merely like a burr, but
like a pitch-plaister, the advantage of such a system is incalculable.—</p>

<p class='c011'>Happy are they, who live in the dream of their own existence,
and see all things in the light of their own minds; who walk by faith
and hope, not by knowledge; to whom the guiding-star of their
youth still shines from afar, and into whom the spirit of the world
has not entered! They have not been ‘hurt by the archers,’ nor has
the iron entered their souls. They live in the midst of arrows, and
of death, unconscious of harm. The evil thing comes not nigh them.
The shafts of ridicule pass unheeded by, and malice loses its sting.
Their keen perceptions do not catch at hidden mischiefs, nor cling to
every folly. The example of vice does not rankle in their breasts,
like the poisoned shirt of Nessus. Evil impressions fall off from
them, like drops of water. The yoke of life is to them light and
supportable. The world has no hold on them. They are in it, not
of it; and a dream and a glory is ever about them.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>EXTRACTS FROM THE ESSAY ON POPULATION<br /> <span class='large'>WITH A COMMENTARY, AND NOTES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I intended to have added another Letter on the principle of population
as affecting the laws of property, and the condition of the poor.
But I found it impossible to combat some of Mr. Malthus’s opinions
without bringing vouchers for them. I might otherwise seem to be
combating the chimeras of my own brain. There are some instances
of perverse reasoning so gross and mischievous, that without seeing
the confidence with which they are insisted on, it seems a waste of
time to contradict them. The reader may perhaps have had something
of this feeling already. By throwing the remainder of the
work into the form of Extracts with notes I shall at least avoid the
imputation of ascribing to Mr. Malthus singularities he never dreamt
of, and have an opportunity of remarking upon some incidental
passages, which appeared to me liable to objection in the perusal. My
remarks will be confined almost entirely to the two last books of the
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘M. Condorcet’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progres de
l’esprit humain</span></i>, was written, it is said, under the pressure of that
cruel proscription which terminated in his death. If he had no hopes
of its being seen during his life, and of its interesting France in
his favour, it is a singular instance of the attachment of a man to
principles, which every day’s experience was, so fatally for himself,
contradicting. To see the human mind, in one of the most enlightened
nations of the world, debased by such a fermentation of disgusting
passions, of fear, cruelty, malice, revenge, ambition, madness, and
folly, as would have disgraced the most savage nations in the most
barbarous age, must have been such a tremendous shock to his ideas
of the necessary and inevitable progress of the human mind, that
nothing but the firmest conviction of the truth of his principles, in
spite of all appearances, could have withstood.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Mr. Malthus in his pick-thank way, here takes occasion to sneer at
Condorcet for his attachment to principles, which, he asserts, every
day’s experience was contradicting. As this of mine is not a pick-thank
work, I must take the liberty of observing, as I have never
read M. Condorcet’s work, that if his ideas of the future progress of
the human mind were the same as those of other writers on the
subject, that debasement of character, and that mass of disgusting
passions, which developed themselves in the events to which Mr.
Malthus here alludes, were the strongest confirmation of the necessity
of getting rid of those institutions which had thus degraded the
human character, and under which such passions had been fostered:
for to say that the progress of the human mind, in spite of those
institutions, was necessary and inevitable, or that there were no such
passions as fear, cruelty, malice, revenge, &amp;c. belonging to the
character generated by the old system in France (in which an
immediate change could not be expected without a miracle) would
have been such a contradiction to common sense, and to all their
own favourite schemes of reform, as no madman in the height of
revolutionary madness was ever guilty of. All that could ever be
pretended by the advocates of reform was that there were capacities
for improvement in the mind, which had hitherto notwithstanding the
advantages of knowledge been thwarted by human institutions. The
contradiction rests therefore not with Condorcet, but with our author.
The same objection has been often made, and often refuted. But
there are some reasoners who care little how often a fallacy has been
exposed, if they know there are people who are still inclined to
listen to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This posthumous publication is only a sketch of a much larger
work which he proposed should be executed. It necessarily wants,
therefore, that detail and application, which can alone prove the truth
of any theory.’ [This remark I cannot admit. I do not think for
instance that any detail or application is necessary to prove the truth
of Mr. Malthus’s general principle of the disproportion between the
power of increase in population, and in the productions of the earth,
or to shew the bad consequences of an unrestricted increase of population.]
‘A few observations will be sufficient to shew how completely
this theory is contradicted, when it is applied to the real and not to
an imaginary state of things.’ [The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-sens</span></i> implied in this
expression is not a slip of the pen, but a fixed principle in Mr.
Malthus’s mind.] He has a very satisfactory method of answering
all theories relating to any imaginary alterations or improvements in
the condition of mankind, by shewing what would be the consequences
of a certain state of society, if no such state of society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>really existed, but if every thing remained just as it is at present.
He thinks it sound sense and true philosophy to judge of a theory
which is confessedly imaginary or has never been realized by comparing
it ‘with the real and not with an imaginary state of things.’
That is, he does not adopt the necessarian maxim that men will be
always the same while the circumstances continue, but he insists upon
it that they will be always the same, whether the circumstances are
the same or not. Some instances have already appeared of this in
the foregoing work. The following passage may serve as another
instance. After supposing Mr. Godwin’s system of equality to be
realized to its utmost extent, and the most perfect form of society
established, he exclaims, ‘this would indeed be a happy state; but
that it is merely an imaginary state with scarcely a feature near the
<em>truth</em>, the reader, I am afraid, is already too well convinced.’
Mr. Godwin himself was I apprehend very well convinced that this
imaginary state was very different from the truth or from the present
state of things, when he wrote his book to shew how much better the
one <em>would be</em> than the other <em>is</em>. He then goes on, ‘Man cannot live
in the midst of plenty. All cannot share alike the bounties of
nature. Were there no established administration of property, every
man would be obliged to guard with force his little store. Selfishness
would be triumphant. The subjects of contention would be perpetual,’
&amp;c. If there were no established administration of property,
while men continued as selfish as they are at present, (which is I
suppose what Mr. Malthus means by applying the theory <em>to the real
state of things</em>‘) the consequences here mentioned would no doubt
follow. But it is supposed that there is no established administration
of property, because the necessity for it has ceased or because selfishness
is not triumphant, but vanquished. This is the supposition.
Mr. Malthus however persists, that were there no established
administration of property, ‘every man would be obliged to guard
with force his little store since selfishness would still be as triumphant
as ever.’ This is contrary to all the received rules of reasoning.
He then proceeds to examine, how long Mr. Godwin’s theory if
once realized might be expected to last, and how soon the present
vices of men would discompose this <em>perfect</em> form of society, concluding
very wisely that ‘a theory that will not admit of application cannot
possibly be just.’ True: if a man tells you that a triangle has
certain properties, he is bound to make good this theory with respect
to a triangle, but not with respect to a circle.—The outcry which
Mr. Malthus here makes about experience is without any meaning.
It is evident that we cannot make this word a rule in all cases whatever.
For instance, if a man who is in the habit of drinking a bottle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of brandy every day of his life and consequently enjoys but an
indifferent state of health, is advised by his physician to leave off this
practice, and told that <em>on this condition</em> he may recover his health and
appetite, it would not be considered as a proof of any great wisdom
in the man, if he were to answer this reasoning of his physician by
applying it to the real, and not to an imaginary state of things, or
by saying, ‘The consequences you promise me from submitting to
your regimen are indeed very desirable; but I cannot expect any such
consequences from it: I have always been in very bad health from
the habit I have constantly been in of drinking brandy; and it would
be contrary to the experience of my whole life to suppose, that I
should receive any benefit from leaving it off.’ In like manner, I conceive
that it is not from any great depth of philosophy, but from the
strength of his attachment to the good things of this life, that
Mr. Malthus makes so many ill-judged appeals to experience. He
is afraid of launching into the empty regions of abstraction, he stands
shivering on the brink; or if he ventures a little way, soon turns back
again, frightened out of his wits, and muttering something about
population. His imagination cannot sustain for a moment the idea of
any real improvement or elevation in the human character, but instantly
drops down into the filth of vice and misery, out of which it had just
crawled. His attempts at philosophy put me in mind of the exploits
of those citizens who set out on a Sunday morning to take an excursion
into the country, resolved to taste the fresh air, and not be confined
for ever to the same spot, but who get no farther than Paddington,
White Conduit-house, or Bagnigge-wells, unable to leave the smoke,
the noise and dust, to which they have so long been used! Mr.
Malthus is a perfect <em>cockney</em> in matters of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Condorcet, allowing that there must in all stages of society be
a number of individuals who have no other resource than their
industry, or that ‘there exists a necessary cause of inequality, of
dependence and even of misery,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> which menaces without ceasing the
most numerous and active class of the community,’ proposes to
establish a fund, which should assure to the old an assistance, produced
in part <em>by their own former savings</em>, and partly by the savings
of others, who die before they reap the benefit of it; and that this
fund might extend to women and children, who had lost their
husbands or fathers, and afford a capital to young beginners, sufficient
for the developement of their industry. To those who have not
fathomed all the depths and shoals of the principle of population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>this plan seems feasible enough. Mr. Malthus’s cautious reserved
humanity, his anxious concern about the support of the aged, the
infirm, the widow, and the orphan, his wish to give every encouragement
to industry, and above all, his regard for the rights and
independence of his fellows, lead him to see nothing but difficulties
and objections in the way of such a plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Such establishments may appear very promising upon paper; but
when applied to real life, they will be found to be absolutely nugatory.
M. Condorcet allows, that a class of people which maintains itself
entirely by industry is necessary to every state. Why does he allow
this? No other reason can well be assigned, than because he conceives,
that the labour necessary to procure subsistence for an extended
population, will not be performed without the goad of necessity. If
by establishments, upon the plans that have been mentioned, this spur
to industry be removed; if the idle and negligent be placed upon the
same footing with regard to their credit, and the future support of
their wives and families, as the active and industrious, can we expect
to see men exert that animated activity in bettering their condition,
which now forms the master-spring of publick prosperity. If an
inquisition were to be established to examine the claims of each
individual, and to determine whether he had, or had not, exerted
himself to the utmost, and to grant or refuse assistance accordingly,
this would be little else than a repetition upon a larger scale, of the
English poor laws, and would be completely destructive of the true
principles of liberty and equality.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This passage only shews the shyness of our author’s benevolence.
He will hear of no short-cuts or obvious expedients for bettering the
condition of the poor. All his benefits are extracted by the Cæsarean
operation.—In the first place, he contradicts himself. He first
supposes that labour cannot be performed without the <em>goad of necessity</em>,
and then affirms that it is <em>the prospect of bettering their condition</em>, that
makes men exert themselves, and forms the master-spring of public
prosperity. But why is it necessary that the idle and negligent
should be put upon the same footing with the industrious, with respect
to their credit, the support of their families, &amp;c.? As to the first of
these, it is proposed to be only temporary, to serve as a beginning,
and if a proper use is not made of it, the goad of necessity, to which
Mr. Malthus is so ready to resort on all occasions, will soon begin to
do its office. As to the second object, the support of a surviving
family, in case of accidents, did Mr. Malthus never hear of any
distress produced in this way, but in consequence of the idleness and
negligence of the deceased? Is not a poor family necessarily reduced
to distress by the death of the husband, let his industry and sobriety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>have been never so great, and even reduced to greater distress in proportion
to his industry, as they must miss his help the more? Besides,
it is not likely that the withholding this assistance from a man’s family
after his death will be any inducement to the idle and negligent to
exert themselves, when the sight of the actual distress in which their
families are involved by their ill conduct has no effect upon them. I
see no objection to proportioning the allowance to the old, or to those
who have had time to make a provision for themselves, to the contributions
they have really made to the fund in a given length of
time. This would be a sufficient test of the validity of their pretensions,
as they could not contribute largely, without proportionably
straitening themselves, and the idle and profligate are not very apt to
part with their present gains to provide for any speculative uncertainties
or future difficulty. (Mr. Malthus may measure the support
allotted to their families in the same way.) While the distinction of
the idle and industrious continued, and while it was necessary to
encourage the one and discountenance the other, I do not understand
what objection there can be to this mode, or how it would trench
upon the true principles of liberty and equality. True equality
supposes equal merit and virtue. But Mr. Malthus is alarmed at
this scheme, because, he says, it is little else than a repetition on a
larger scale of the English poor laws. If the English poor laws are
formed upon this principle, I should, I confess, be very sorry to see
them abolished.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Were every man sure of a comfortable provision for a family,
almost every man would have one; and were the rising generation
free from the “killing frost” of misery, population must increase with
unusual rapidity.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is an utter falsification of the argument, as I have already
shewn. Every man could not be sure of a comfortable provision for
a family, unless this provision existed, and I see no reason why the
rising generation should not be free from the killing frost of misery,
at least while they can. To argue that our enlightened posterity
will feel ‘secure that the general benevolence will supply every
deficiency,’ is to suppose them strangely unacquainted with the
principles of Mr. Malthus’s Essay.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The period when the number of men surpass their means of
subsistence has long since arrived.’ p. 357.</p>

<p class='c011'>This I must deny. That the period of the utmost degree of
populousness would have arrived long ago, if nothing had prevented
it, I am very ready to grant. But that it has ever actually arrived,
is another question. Because population would have arrived at its
greatest possible or desirable height long before our time, if it had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>been kept back by any artificial and arbitrary checks, is that any
reason why it should never attain that height, or should not now be
suffered to go on, though those checks have always operated to keep
it back much more than was necessary, viz. below the level not only
of the possible, but of the <em>actual</em> means of subsistence or produce of
the earth? As to the period when the world is likely to maintain
the greatest possible number of inhabitants in the greatest possible
comfort, I have no notion that it will ever arrive at all. If however
it should ever arrive, it must be in consequence either of a gradual or
immediate complete improvement in the state of society. If this improvement
is gradual, the increase in population will be so too, and
will not reach its farthest limit till a considerably remote period; if
the improvement is sudden and rapid, still it must be some time before
the operation of the new system of things will have overcome all
obstacles, and completely peopled the earth. So that in either case
the event seems a good way off. The danger of arriving at this
point does not therefore appear to be ‘immediate or imminent,’ but
doubtful and distant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus in his examination of Condorcet’s arguments, in
favour of the indefinite prolongation of human life, (one of those
absurdities against which no good reason can be given, but that it
shocks all common sense) shews considerable ingenuity, mixed up
with a great deal of that minute verbal logic, to which he seems to
have accustomed his mind, and which is perpetually leading him into
erroneous methods of reasoning, even when he happens to be right in
his conclusions. As in the following passages.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Variations from different causes are essentially distinct from a
regular and unretrograde increase. The average duration of human
life will, to a certain degree, vary, from healthy or unhealthy climates,
from wholesome or unwholesome food, from virtuous or vicious
manners, and other causes; but it may be fairly doubted, whether
there has been really the smallest perceptible advance in the natural
duration of human life, since first we had any authentic history of
man. The prejudices of all ages have, indeed, been directly contrary
to this supposition.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Now this statement is very unsatisfactory, to say the least. For
the only reason that can be given why the causes here mentioned, on
which Mr. M. allows that the duration of human life depends, have
not produced a regular and permanent effect <em>must be</em>, that they themselves
have neither been regular nor permanent. The mere fact,
therefore, of the variableness in the length of human life proves
nothing but the variableness of those moral and artificial causes, which
are supposed to have some influence on our physical constitution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>But Condorcet supposes a regular advance to be made in these causes,
and that an indefinite advance in some of them (as the knowledge of
medicine for instance) is probable, will hardly be disputed. The
question (in this point of view) of the necessary duration of human
life is not properly a question of fact, or history, but depends on a
comparison of the present circumstances of mankind with their past
circumstances, and on the probability that may thence appear of
preventing or counteracting those maladies and passions which are
most unfavourable to long life. That our reason may sometimes get
the start of our experience is what no one can deny. Thus when
the art of printing was first discovered it required no great stretch of
thought to perceive that knowledge and learning would soon become
more generally diffused than they had hitherto been, though till this
event no perceptible or regular progress had ever been made. Those
who reason otherwise are a kind of stereographic reasoners who take
things in the lump without being able to analyse or connect their
different principles. Experience is but the alphabet of reason. With
respect to the general shortness of human life compared with what
it was in the first ages of mankind, this fact seems rather against Mr.
Malthus, for if there is no certain date, no settled period to human
life, beyond which it cannot hold out, but that it has varied from a
thousand to a hundred years, so far there is no reason why we should
not tread back our steps, or even go beyond the point from which we
set out. There is no fixed limit; the present length of human life
is not evidently a general law of nature. The mere naked fact of its
never exceeding a certain length at present is just as decisive against
its ever having been longer, as it is against its ever being longer in
future. Mr. Malthus argues about human life, as Hume argues about
miracles.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It will be said, perhaps, that the reason why plants and animals
cannot increase indefinitely in size, is, that they would fall by their
own weight. I answer, how do we know this but from experience?
from experience of the degree of strength with which these bodies
are formed. I know that a carnation, long before it reached the size
of a cabbage, would not be supported by its stalk; but I only know
this from my experience of the weakness, and want of tenacity in the
materials of a carnation stalk. There are many substances in nature,
of the same size, that would support as large a head as a cabbage.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The reasons of the mortality of plants are at present perfectly
unknown to us. No man can say why such a plant is annual,
another biennial, and another endures for ages. The whole affair in
all these cases, in plants, animals, and in the human race, is an affair
of experience; and I only conclude that man is mortal, because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>invariable experience of all ages has proved the mortality of those
materials of which his visible body is made.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is making use of words without ideas. It is endeavouring
to confound two things essentially distinct, because the same lax
expression may be applied to them both. It is an attempt to deprive
men of their understanding, and leave them nothing but the use of
their senses, by a trick of language. Does it follow because all our
knowledge may be traced in some way to something which may be
called <em>experience</em>, that all our conclusions are nothing but an affair of
memory? Does Mr. Malthus know of only one sort of experience?
Is there not a blind and a rational experience? Is it not one thing
merely to know a fact, or a number of facts, and another to know
the <em>reason</em> of them? Or if our philosopher is determined to intrench
himself behind a word, is there not a knowledge founded on the
experience of certain positive results, (which often extends no further
than those results) and a knowledge founded on the experience of
certain general principles or laws, to which all particular effects are
subject? Mr. Malthus seems to insinuate that the knowledge of the
general law or principle adds nothing to the knowledge of the fact,
because both are equally an affair of experience. He might as well
assert that a ligature of iron would not strengthen a deal plank,
because they are both held together by the same law of cohesion.
The fact expresses nothing more than the actual co-existence of
certain things in certain circumstances, and while all those circumstances
continue, no doubt the same consequences will follow. But
we know that they are hardly ever the same, and the question is,
which of them is necessary to produce the effect talked of. This
the <em>reason</em> points out, that is, it points out a relation between
certain things, which has been found to hold not merely in the given
circumstances, but in all others, which is properly the relation of
cause and effect. Our idea of cause and effect is not derived from
our immediate but from our <em>comparative</em> experience: it is only by
taking our experience to pieces, by seeing what things are, or are
not necessarily connected together in different circumstances, that we
learn to reason with clearness and confidence on the succession of
events.</p>

<p class='c011'>The succession of events is not the same thing as the succession
of cause and effect. By assigning a reason for a thing, I mean then
being able to refer it to a general rule or principle collected from and
proved by an infinite number of collateral instances, and confirming
the particular fact or instance to which it is applied. It is drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>together the different ramifications of our experience, and winding
them round a particular bundle of things, and tying them fast together.
Thus suppose we have never seen a carnation of the size of
a cabbage: does it follow that we never shall, or that there can be
no such thing? We might say, I know no <em>reason</em> why a flower of
a certain shape, colour, &amp;c. should not reach a certain size, but that
it has never been so within my knowledge. This might however be
owing to the soil, culture, or a thousand circumstances, which are
not invariable.—But the moment the reason is given (supposing it to
be a good one) namely, the connection between the contexture and
weight, (though this reason is also derived indirectly from the general
fund of our experience) there is an end at once of the question. To
suppose a flower to grow to a greater height than it could support
from the slenderness of the stalk would be to suppose what never
happened not only with respect to that particular flower, the carnation,
but with respect to any other flower, or plant, or animal, or any other
body whatever. We know that climate has such an effect that what
are plants with us, in the tropical climates become large trees: but
the necessary proportion between the size or weight of the plant,
and the strength of the stalk that is to support it, is what no change
of soil or climate can supersede, unless we could supersede the law
of gravitation itself. The mere experimental or historical proof is
here then buttressed up by the general rule, or reason of the thing.—I
have always seen a stone fall to the ground; I remember a house
always to have stood where it does; a hill has never stirred from the
place where I first saw it. Is the inference to be drawn from these
different cases equally certain? Am I to conclude that the house
will last as long as the mountain, because I have the same positive
evidence of their permanence? No: because though I have never
seen any alteration in that particular house, I have seen other houses
pulled down and built up; and besides, from the size of the objects,
the shape and nature of the materials, I know that one of them may
be very easily destroyed, whereas nothing but some great convulsion
in nature is ever likely to destroy the other or remove it from its
place. Our particular experience is only to be depended on, as it is
explained and confirmed by analogy to other cases, viz. by a number
of other facts of the same kind, or by general observation. Secondly,
the aggregate of our experience with respect to any given class of
events is constantly over-ruled by the <em>reason of the case</em>, viz. by our
knowledge of cause and effect, by the intelligible, explicit connections
of things, and by considering whether the principles concerned in the
production of a series of events, (forming a body of facts, or the
concrete mass of our experience) are resolvable into a simple law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of nature operating universally, unchangeably, without ever being
suspended for a moment, (as for instance, the law of gravitation
which holds equally of all bodies in all cases, and can never be
separated from our reasonings upon them) or whether the event has
been owing to a combination of mixed causes, which do not always
act alike and with equal force, or the effect of which depends upon
circumstances, which we know may be altered, (as in the case of
soils, climates, methods of culture,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> &amp;c. to return to the former
example). Suppose a rock to have stood for ages on the summit of
a mountain. Am I sure that it will stand there always? Yes, if
nothing happens to prevent it. But can I be sure that nothing will
ever remove it, because nothing has ever done so hitherto? On the
contrary, I know that if a man points a cannon against it, it will be
shattered to pieces in an instant, though it has stood there for ages,
and though there is not at present the least appearance of a change in
it. Here then my experience is of no avail against my reason. In
one sense of the word, it is all thrown away, and goes for nothing.
To judge rationally, I must take other circumstances into the account,
the effects of gunpowder, &amp;c. The resistance made by the rock will
depend upon its hardness, not upon the length of time it had stood
there. Our experience then is not one thing, or any number of
things, taken absolutely or blindly by themselves, but a vast collection
of facts, and what is of infinitely more importance, of rules, founded
upon those facts, bearing one upon another, and perpetually modified
by circumstances. It is not upon any single fact or class of facts,
or on any single rule, but on the combination of all these, and the
manner in which they balance and control one another, that our
decisions must ultimately rest. It is from this rational and abstracted
experience that we obtain any certain results, and infer from the
altered relation of causes and events, that things will happen which
never happened before. The future is contained in the past, only as
it grows out of the same powers in nature, but acting in different
situations, and producing different practical results by invariable laws.
To apply all this to the question. If it is allowed that the improvements
in physic have an influence on the duration of human life, and
that these improvements may go on indefinitely, I do not think Mr.
Malthus’s answer a conclusive one that no considerable progress will
ever be made in this respect, because none has hitherto been made.
If the improvements in science have not hitherto been regular and
permanent, it cannot be expected that any advantages depending on
them should have been so: nor does the past history of mankind in
this instance furnish a rule for our future conjectures, inasmuch as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>all that relates to the permanence and general diffusion of knowledge,
a new turn has been given to the question (as before observed) by
the invention of printing. This single circumstance, which was
matter of mere accident, may be said in many respects to have given
a new aspect to human affairs; to say that it has not yet produced
the effects predicted from it, when it has had no time to produce
them, is like saying, that the repeated blows of a battering-ram will
not break down a stone-wall, because for the two or three first blows
it does not begin to move. The true question is, whether the cause
is adequate to the effect ascribed to it, that is, whether its operation
is of a sufficiently general and powerful nature to produce a correspondent
general change in the circumstances of mankind. I think
it will hardly be denied that printing may be applied with great
success as an instrument for the propagation of vice: may it not then
be made use of to give currency to the principles of virtue? At any
rate, to deny that it is a means of diffusing and embodying knowledge
is to deny that such a contrivance exists at all, or that books will be
more generally read, or less liable to be lost from the facility with
which they are multiplied. While therefore Mr. Malthus allows
certain moral habits, and the state of physical knowledge in a great
measure to determine the length of human life, he cannot object on
any allowed principles of philosophy to M. Condorcet’s employing
these causes as intermediate links in a chain of argument to establish
the probability of the gradual approach of mankind—to a state of
immortality. The error does not lie in M. Condorcet’s general
principles of reasoning, but in the wrong application of them; though
I do not know that I could detect the error better than Mr. Malthus
has done. What I have endeavoured to shew in these hasty remarks
is that the admission of the rule laid down by our author, that in our
calculations of the future, we are to attend to nothing but the general
state of the fact hitherto, without giving any weight to the actual
change of collateral circumstances, or the existence of any new cause
which may influence the state of that fact, would overturn every
principle, not only of sound philosophy, but of the most obvious
common sense.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> I dissent equally from M. Condorcet’s paradoxical
speculations and from Mr. Malthus’s paradoxical answers to them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>It would be unfair not to add that Mr. Malthus has made one good
distinction on the subject, between an unlimited and an indefinite
improvement. It is the old argument of the Heap, and is here stated
with considerable effect, and novelty of appearance. The conclusion
of Mr. Malthus’s argument on this idle question is a sensible and
pleasant account of the matter. After all, I do not quite dislike a
man who quotes Bickerstaff so well.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It does not, however, by any means, seem impossible, that by
an attention to breed, a certain degree of improvement, similar to that
among animals, might take place among men. Whether intellect
could be communicated may be a matter of doubt: but size, strength,
beauty, complexion, and perhaps even longevity, are in a degree
transmissible. The error does not seem to lie, in supposing a small
degree of improvement possible, but in not discriminating between a
small improvement, the limit of which is undefined, and an improvement
really unlimited. As the human race, however, could not be
improved in this way, without condemning all the bad specimens to
celibacy, it is not probable, that an attention to breed should ever
become general; indeed, I know of no well-directed attempts of the
kind, except in the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs, who are said
to have been very successful in whitening the skins, and increasing
the height of their race by prudent marriages, particularly by that
very judicious cross with Maud the milk-maid, by which some very
capital defects in the constitutions of the family were corrected.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus afterwards adds, ‘When paradoxes of this kind are
advanced by ingenious and able men, neglect has no tendency to convince
them of their mistakes. Priding themselves on what they
conceive to be a mark of the reach and size of their own understandings,
of the extent and comprehensiveness of their views; they
will look upon this neglect merely as an indication of poverty, and
narrowness, in the mental exertions of their contemporaries; and only
think, that the world is not yet prepared to receive their sublime
truths.’—This is said <em>bitingly</em> enough. For my own part, I conceive
that the world is neither prepared to receive, nor reject, nor answer
them, nor decide any thing about them but that they are contrary to
all our notions of things, which, till we know more about the matter,
is perhaps a sufficient answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Mr. Godwin at the conclusion of the third chapter of his eighth
book, speaking of population, says, “There is a principle in human
society, by which population is perpetually kept down to the level of
the means of subsistence. Thus, among the wandering tribes of
America and Asia, we never find, through the lapse of ages, that
population has so increased as to render necessary the cultivation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the earth.” This principle, which Mr. Godwin thus mentions as
some mysterious and occult cause, and which he does not attempt to
investigate, has appeared to be the grinding law of necessity—misery,
and the fear of misery.’</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a want of clearness here. The cause which Mr. Malthus
thus explains so accurately has still something dark and mysterious
about it. With respect to the savage tribes Mr. Malthus states in
another place, that it is not owing to the backwardness of population
that agriculture has never become necessary, but to the want of agriculture
that population has never increased among them. The
passage is worth quoting. ‘It is not, therefore,’ he says, ‘as Lord
Kaimes imagines, that the American tribes have never increased sufficiently
to render the pastoral or agricultural state necessary to them;
but, from some cause or other,’ [Mr. Malthus also deals in occult causes]
‘they have not adopted in any great degree these more plentiful
modes of procuring subsistence, and therefore, cannot have increased
so as to have become populous. If hunger alone could have prompted
the savage tribes of America to such a change in their habits, I do
not conceive that there would have been a single nation of hunters
and fishers remaining; but it is evident, that some fortunate train of
circumstances, in addition to this stimulus, is necessary for this
purpose; and it is undoubtedly probable, that these arts of obtaining
food, will be first invented and improved in those spots that are best
suited to them, and where the natural fertility of the situation,’ [Is
not the soil of America sufficiently fertile?] ‘by allowing a greater
number of people to subsist together, would give the fairest chance to
the inventive powers of the human mind.’—Here then we see ‘the
grinding law of necessity’ converted into a ‘fortunate train of
circumstances,’ so that we have a fact arising from a <em>necessary cause</em>,
and that necessary cause depending on an <em>accident</em>. The population
is kept down to the level of the means of subsistence, but not to <em>what
it is</em>, by the law of necessity; since there are ways and means of
raising that level, and the population along with it. Notwithstanding
all the misery, and all the fear of misery, which Mr. Malthus
describes as thus operating to keep population down to its proper
level, he is altogether unwilling to lighten their pressure, or to
extend the benefits of that fortunate train of circumstances and of
those more plentiful modes of obtaining food beyond their present
necessary limits. Nothing can exceed his jealousy on this point.
He is apprehensive lest some speculative philosopher should take it
into his head ‘to exterminate the inhabitants of the greatest part of
Asia and Africa’ on a principle of humanity. He proposes rather
‘to civilize and direct the industry of the various tribes of Tartars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and Negroes, as a work of considerable time, and as having little
chance of success.’ He looks with an enlightened concern at the
encroachments daily made by the thriving population of the colonies
on the deserts and uncultivated plains of North America, grieving to
see the few scattered inhabitants driven ‘from their assigned and native
dwelling-place,’ and foreseeing that by this means the whole population
of that vast continent will be some time or other completely
choaked up! It is, I know, a painful object to Mr. Malthus (I
cannot tell how it happens) to see plenty, comfort, civilisation and
numerous swarms of people succeed to want, ignorance, famine,
misery, and desolation. Those who are the well-wishers of the
happiness of mankind (among which number I reckon Mr. Malthus
one) are always diverted from their projects by their own delicacy
and scruples. Those who wish to enslave or destroy them never
boggle at difficulties, or stand upon ceremony!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus says that the principle, by which population is
perpetually kept down to a certain level is the grinding law of
necessity—misery and the fear of misery. This may be true of the
savage tribes there spoken of, but if he means to apply it generally,
‘it is not in any degree near the truth.’ At this rate, all those who
do not formally set about propagating their species ought to be
restrained by want or the fear of it. Is this the fact? Misery or
the fear of misery may be the check to population among the poor,
but it cannot be the check to it among the rich. Yet we do not find
that the rich, any more than the poor, regularly marry and get
children. If this were the case, the rich would long ago have
multiplied themselves into beggars. They would all have descendants,
and those descendants would have others, till the world would not
have room for such a number of poor gentlemen. All their wealth
would be turned into rags, and they would be glad of a crust of
bread. The world would be one great work-house.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> There must
therefore be some other principle which checks population among the
higher classes, and makes them stop short within many degrees of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>actual poverty, besides ‘misery and the fear of misery.’ They do
not even come within sight of misery: the fact is that they are as
unwilling to descend from the highest pitch of luxury as the poor are
to sink into the lowest state of want.—Mr. Malthus by asserting in
this careless manner that population can only be checked by
misery or the fear of misery, gains a main point. He has always a
certain quantity of misery <em>in bank</em>, as you must put so much salt in
your porridge, and so many poor devils standing on the brink of
wretchedness, as a sort of out-guard or forlorn hope, to ward off the
evils of population from the society at large. Thus the enemy is
sure to be defeated, before it can make any impression on the body
of the community. This would be very well if we had to deal with
an external, and not with an internal enemy. But is it the poor then
only, who are subject to this disease of population? Are the rich
quite proof against the evils of this all-pervading principle, this
inevitable law of nature? If the account which Mr. Malthus gives
of that principle were true, its ravages could no more be checked by
devoting a certain class of the community to glut ‘its ravenous maw,’
than you could keep the plague out of a house by placing some one at
the door to catch it. Either misery and the dread of misery are not
absolutely necessary to keep population within due bounds, or nothing
short of the general spread of misery and poverty through the whole
community could save us from it. Mr. Malthus tries to shut the
gates of mercy on mankind by an ill-natured manœuvre! From the
little trouble our author gives himself about the application of his
arithmetical and geometrical ratios to the rich, and his confidence in
the method of inoculating the poor only by way of prevention, one
would suppose that the former had no concern in the affair: that
‘they neither marry nor are given in marriage’; but leaving the vulgar
business of procreation to their inferiors, only look on to see that
they do not overstock the world. Why no, says Mr. Malthus, I
have always insisted on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</span></i> as one of the necessary checks to
population; and though in the upper ranks of life, the restraints
on marriage cannot be said to be imposed by misery or the fear of
misery, yet it cannot be denied that these restraints lead to a great
deal of vice and profligacy, which answer the purpose just as well.—There
is one merit I shall not deny to Mr. Malthus, which is, that
he has adapted his remedies with great skill and judgment to the
different tempers, habits, and circumstances of his patients. In his
division of the evils of human life, he has allotted to the poor <em>all</em> the
misery, and to the rich <em>as much vice as they please</em>! These last will I
daresay be very well satisfied with this distribution.—These remarks
sufficiently shew that we cannot apologize for all the misery there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>in the world by saying, that nothing else can put a stop to the evils of
population; nor for all the vice, by saying that it is the alternative of
misery. It cannot be pretended, that no one would ever indulge in
vicious gratifications, but from the apprehension of reducing himself
to want by having a family.—‘But he cannot maintain them in a
certain style.’—True: vice is then a very convenient auxiliary to
pride, vanity, luxury, artificial distinctions, &amp;c. but it is not a resource
against want. I once knew an instance of a gentleman and lady who had
a very romantic passion for each other, but who could not afford to marry
because they could only muster seven thousand pounds between them.
Were they not to be pitied? What could they do in this case?
Why, the lady no doubt would behave with all the wonted fortitude
of her sex on the occasion: but the poor man must certainly be
driven into vicious courses. Oh! no: I had forgot he was a clergyman;
and his cloth would not admit of any such thing. Vice does
not therefore seem to be <em>always</em> a necessary consequence of the
obstacles to marriage. Moral restraint is always practicable, where the
opinion of the world renders it necessary. At all events, I conceive
that either one or the other of Mr. Malthus’s remedies may be dispensed
with: they are not <em>both</em> necessary. By his own account, (as
formerly seen) extreme poverty is a very ineffectual bar to population;
and as to vice, if it could be administered in doses, proportioned to the
occasion, so much and no more, it might be an excellent cure; but
the misfortune is, that when it once begins, there is no end of it.
To change my metaphor, it takes the bit in its mouth, and sets off at
a glorious rate, without the least spur from necessity, always keeping
as much a-head of the occasion as Mr. Malthus’s geometrical series
keeps a-head of his arithmetical one. Some persons may perhaps
argue, that there is a natural connection between vice and misery, inasmuch
as without the temptation of want among the poor, the vices
of the rich would lack proper objects to exercise themselves upon: so
that, there being no one to offer temptation to, and no one having any
very great temptations to offer, people would be forced to marry among
their <em>equals</em>, unless the trifling consideration of not being able to
provide immediately for a large family should induce them to moderate
their passions for a while. This is an argument which I shall not
controvert: the disturbing that beautiful harmony and dependence
which at present subsists between vice and misery would certainly
lead us back in a great measure to all the evils which Mr. Malthus
anticipates as arising out of a state of excessive virtue and happiness,
and the most perfect form of society.</p>

<p class='c011'>I shall here quote at large Mr. Malthus’s account of the origin of
the distinctions of property as necessarily arising from the pressure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>population on the means of subsistence, and from that principle solely.
I shall mark what I think the most noticeable parts in italics, and
make some observations at the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It may be curious to observe in the case that we have been
supposing, how some of the principal laws, which at present govern
civilized society, would be successively dictated by the most imperious
necessity. As man, according to Mr. Godwin, is the creature of the
impressions to which he is subject, the goadings of want could not
continue long before some violations of public or private stock would
necessarily take place. As these violations increased in number and
extent, <em>the more active and comprehensive intellects of the society would
soon perceive</em>, that while population was fast increasing, the yearly
produce of the country would shortly begin to diminish. The urgency
of the case would suggest the necessity of some immediate measures
being taken for the general safety. Some kind of convention would
then be called, and the dangerous situation of the country stated in
the strongest terms. <em>It would be observed, that while they lived in the
midst of plenty it was of little consequence who laboured the least, or who
possessed the least, as every man was perfectly willing and ready to supply
the wants of his neighbour. But that the question was no longer whether
one man should give to another that which he did not use himself; but
whether he should give to his neighbour the food which was absolutely
necessary to his own existence. It would be represented that the number
of those who were in want very greatly exceeded the number and means
of those who should supply them</em>; that these pressing wants, which from
the state of the produce of the country, could not all be gratified, had
occasioned some flagrant violations of justice; that these violations
had already checked the increase of food, and would, if they were not
by some means or other prevented, throw the whole community into
confusion: that imperious necessity seemed to dictate, that a yearly
increase of produce should, if possible, be obtained at all events; that
in order to effect this first great and indispensable purpose it would be
advisable to make a more complete division of land, and to secure
every man’s property against violation by the most powerful sanctions.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It might be urged perhaps, by some objectors, that as the fertility
of the land increased, and various accidents occurred, the shares of
some men might be much more than sufficient for their support; and
that when the reign of self-love was once established, <em>they would not
distribute their surplus produce without some compensation in return</em>. It
would be observed in answer, that this was an inconvenience greatly
to be lamented; but that it was an evil which would bear no comparison
to the black train of distresses which would inevitably be
occasioned by the insecurity of property; <em>that the quantity of food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>which one man could consume, was necessarily limited by the narrow
capacity of the human stomach; that it was not certainly probable that he
should throw away the rest; and if he exchanged his surplus produce for
the labour of others, this would be better than that these others should
absolutely starve.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>‘It seems highly probable therefore, that an administration of
property <em>not very different from that which prevails in civilized states at
present</em> would be established as the best though inadequate remedy for
the evils which were pressing on the society.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The next subject which would come under discussion, intimately
connected with the preceding, is the commerce of the sexes. It
would be urged by those who had turned their attention to the <em>true
cause of the difficulties under which the community laboured, that while
every man felt secure that all his children would be well provided for by
general benevolence, the powers of the earth would be absolutely inadequate
to produce food for the population which would inevitably ensue</em>; that
even if the whole attention and labour of the society were directed to this
sole point, and if by the most perfect security of property, and every
other encouragement that could be thought of, the greatest possible
increase of produce were yearly obtained; yet still the increase of
food would by no means keep pace with the much more rapid increase
of population; that some check to population therefore was imperiously
called for; that the most natural and obvious check seemed to be to
make every man provide for his own children; that this would
operate in some respect as a measure and a guide in the increase of
population, as it might be expected that no man would bring beings
into the world for whom he could not find the means of support; that
where this notwithstanding was the case, it seemed necessary for the
example of others, that the disgrace and inconvenience attending such
a conduct should fall upon that individual who had thus inconsiderately
plunged himself and his innocent children into want and misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The institution of marriage, or at least of some express or implied
obligation on every man to support his own children, seems to be the
natural result of these reasonings in a community under the difficulties
that we have supposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘When these two fundamental laws of society, the security of
property, and the institution of marriage were once established,
inequality of conditions must necessarily follow. Those who were
born after the division of property would come <em>into a world already
possessed</em>. If their parents from having too large a family were unable
to give them sufficient for their support, what could they do in a
world where every thing was appropriated? We have seen the fatal
effects that would result to society if every man had a <em>valid claim to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>equal share of the produce of the earth.</em> The members of a family
which was grown too large for the original division of land appropriated
to it, <em>could not then demand a part of the surplus produce of
others as a debt of justice. It has appeared that from the inevitable laws
of human nature some human beings will be exposed to want. These are
the unhappy persons who in the great lottery of life have drawn a blank.
The number of these persons would soon exceed the ability of the surplus
produce to supply. Moral merit is a very difficult criterion except in
extreme cases. The owners of surplus produce would in general seek
some more obvious mark of distinction; and it seems to be both natural
and just, that except upon particular occasions their choice should fall upon
those who were able, and professed themselves willing to exert their
strength in procuring a further surplus produce, which would at once
benefit the community, and enable the proprietors to afford assistance to
greater numbers. All who were in want of food would be urged by
imperious necessity to offer their labour in exchange for this article, so
absolutely necessary to existence. The fund appropriated to the maintenance
of labour would be the aggregate quantity of food possessed by the owners
of land beyond their own consumption. When the demands upon this fund
were great and numerous it would naturally be divided into very small
shares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare
subsistence; and the rearing of families would be checked by sickness and
misery. On the contrary, when this fund was increasing fast; when it
was great in proportion to the number of claimants, it would be divided in
much larger shares. No man would exchange his labour without
receiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live in
ease and comfort, and would consequently be able to rear a numerous and
vigorous offspring.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>On the state of this fund the happiness or the degree of misery, prevailing
among the lower classes of people in every known state, at present
chiefly depends; and on this happiness or degree of misery depends
principally the increase, stationariness, or decrease of population.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>And thus it appears, that a society constituted according to the most
beautiful form that imagination can conceive, with benevolence for its
moving principle instead of self-love, and with every evil disposition in all
its members corrected by reason, not force, would from the inevitable laws
of nature, and not from any original depravity of man, or of human
institutions, degenerate in a very short period into a society constructed upon
a plan not essentially different from that which prevails in every known
state at present; a society divided into a class of proprietors and a class
of labourers, and with self-love for the mainspring of the great machine</em>;
we may, therefore, venture to pronounce with certainty, that if Mr.
Godwin’s system of society were established in its utmost perfection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>instead of myriads of centuries, not thirty years could elapse before
its utter destruction from the simple principle of population.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Not to insist on the absurdity, with which Mr. Malthus seems to
be enamoured, of believing that the change here predicted would be
the consequence of the inevitable laws of nature, not of any inherent
depravity in the human mind, when it is evident that the whole
mischief originates in the folly and headstrong passions of the
individuals composing this extraordinary society, all the members of
which are actuated by the purest motives of reason and virtue, I shall
at once suppose a state of society not indeed perfect, but equal, and
with self-love, and a little common sense, instead of benevolence and
perfect wisdom, for its moving principles; and see whether it would
not be possible for such a state of practical equality, admitting neither
poverty nor riches, to last more than ‘thirty years, before its <em>utter
destruction from the simple principle of population</em>.’ The question is, if
I understand it rightly, how that principle <em>alone</em> (I do not enter into
the general structure, foundations, or purposes of civil society, I
propose to examine the question only as a branch of political economy,
or as it relates to the physical sustenance of mankind, which is the
point of view in which Mr. Malthus has treated it) how I say that
principle imperiously requires, that there should be one class of the
community, ready to perish of want except as they are kept from it
by severe and unremitting exertion, and another class living in ease
and luxury for no other purpose than to keep the good things of this
life from the first class, because if they were admitted to a share of
them they would be immediately subjected to greater want and hardships
than ever. It is to be remembered that Mr. Malthus here
pretends to bring forward a new theory of property; to have added
the key-stone to the arch of political society, which, he says, was in
danger of falling without it; to enforce the rights of the rich, and set
aside the claims of the poor as false and unfounded; and by shewing
how the distinctions of property are immediately connected with the
physical nature and very existence of mankind in a way that had not
been supposed before, to point out the necessity of arming the law
with new rigour, and steeling the heart with fresh obduracy to second
the decisions of his pragmatical philosophy. The laws of England
recognize the right of the poor man to live by his labour; Mr.
Malthus denies this right, and holds it up to ridicule. The question
is, which of them we shall believe. I shall therefore examine the
subject freely, having so good an authority on my side.</p>

<p class='c011'>All that I can find Mr. Malthus has discovered is, that it would
be necessary in the progress of society, in order to stave off the evils
of population, to make a regulation, that every man should be obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to work for a subsistence, and to provide for his own children. A
great matter truly! But having allowed to Mr. Malthus that these
two regulations would be <em>necessary</em> in the common course of things,
I cannot at the same time help thinking that they would also be
<em>sufficient</em>—to avert the approach of famine, which is the point at
issue. I can easily understand if every man had a valid claim to
an equal share of the produce of the earth, that this abstract unqualified
right would lead to great inconveniences—but not when that
abstract right is clogged with the condition, that he should work for
his share of it. I can also admit that I can have no claim to the
surplus produce of another without some compensation in return.
This would certainly be hard. But it does not appear (upon the
face of the argument) how I should therefore have no claim to the
produce of my own industry; or how any other person has a right to
force me to work for him without making me what compensation I
think fit. <em>He</em> has a right to his estate, <em>I</em> have a right to my labour.
As to any produce, whether surplus or not, which he may raise from
it, he has a right to keep it to himself; as to that which I raise for
him, it seems to be a subject of voluntary agreement. Again, if a
man who is as industrious as myself, and equally reaps the benefit of
his industry chuses to have the additional solace of a wife and family,
as he has all the <em>fun</em>, I see no reason why he should not have all the
trouble; it is neither fair nor equal that I should make a drudge of
myself, or be put to inconvenience for the sake of his amusements.
Let us see then how the argument stands in this stage of it. The
reason which appeared for not allowing to every man a valid claim to
an equal share of the produce of the earth was, that the admission of
such a claim would only be an excuse for idleness. The extravagant,
the worthless, and indolent would thus prey upon the honest and
laborious part of the community. (We are supposing a case where
every evil disposition and original depravity had <em>not</em> been completely
eradicated by reason and philosophy.) Even if no such characters
existed, they would hardly fail to be produced by having such fine
encouragement given them. On the other hand, if every one was at
liberty to saddle his neighbour or the community with as many
children as he pleased, there would either be no sufficient check to
the inordinate increase of population, or at least any one person who
got the start in the race of matrimony would have it in his power to
deprive the others of their right to the surplus produce of their labour
by claiming it for his family. It is necessary then to prevent the
imposition of any one’s fastening himself and children on another for
support, that there should be a certain <em>appropriation of the common
stock</em>; that is, that each man’s claim upon it should be in proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>to the share he had in increasing it. The next consideration is
whether with this hold upon him, you would not be able to make
him effectually exert himself, and at the same time prevent him from
having more children than he could maintain, the same all-powerful
stimulus of self-interest equally counteracting his indolence and his
indiscretion. Mr. Malthus says that the true cause of the difficulties
under which the community would labour, would be the excessive
tendency to population, arising from the security felt by every man
that his children would be well provided for by the general
benevolence: by taking away this security then, and imposing the
task of maintaining them upon himself, you remove the only cause of
the unavoidable tendency of population to excess, and of all the
confusion that would ensue, by making his selfishness and his indolence
operate as direct checks on his sensual propensities. He would be
tied to his good behaviour as effectually as a country fellow is at
present by being bound in a penalty of twenty pounds to the parish
for every bastard child that he gets. If every man’s earnings were
in proportion to his exertions, if his share of the necessaries, the
comforts, or even the superfluities of life were derived from the
produce of his own toil, or ingenuity, or determined by equitable
<em>compensation</em>, I cannot conceive how there could be any greater
security for regularity of conduct and a general spirit of industry
in the several members of the community, as far as was consistent
with health and the real enjoyment of life. If these principles are
not sufficient to ensure the good order of society in such circumstances,
I should like to know what are the principles by which it is
enforced at present. They are nothing more than the regular
connection between industry and its reward, and the additional
charge or labour to which a man necessarily subjects himself by
being encumbered with a family. The only difference is in the
proportion between the reward, and the exertion, or the rate at
which the payment of labour is fixed. So far then we see no very
pressing symptoms of the dissolution of the society, or of any violent
departure from this system of decent equality, from the sole principle
of population. Yet we have not hitherto got (in the regular course of
the argument) so far as the distinction of a class of labourers, and
a class of proprietors. It may be urged perhaps that nothing but
extreme want or misery can furnish a stimulus sufficiently strong to
produce ‘the labour necessary for the support of an extended
population,’ or counteract the principle of population. But Mr.
Malthus himself admits that ‘the most constant and best directed
efforts of industry are to be found among a class of people above the
class of the wretchedly poor,’ among those who have something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>lose, and something to gain, and who, happen what will, cannot be
worse off than they are. He also admits that it is among this
middling class of people, that we are to look for most instances of
self-denial, prudence, and a competent resistance to the principle
of population. I do not therefore understand either the weight or
consistency of the charge which he brings against Paine of having
fallen into the most fundamental errors respecting the principles of
government by confounding the affairs of Europe with those of
America. If the people in America are not forced to labour (and
there are no people more industrious) by extreme poverty, if they are
not forced to be prudent (and their prudence is I believe equal to
their industry) by the scantiness of the soil, or the unequal distribution
of its produce, no matter whether the state is old or new, whether the
population is increasing or stationary, the example proves equally in
all cases that wretchedness is not the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i> of industry, and
that the way to hinder people from taking <em>desperate</em> steps is not to
involve them in despair. The current of our daily life, the springs of
our activity or fortitude, may be supplied as well from hope as fear,
from ‘cheerful and confident thoughts’ as the apparition of famine
stalking just behind us. The merchant attends to his business, settles
his accounts, and answers his correspondents as diligently and punctually
as the shop-keeper. The shop-keeper minds his customers, and puffs
off his goods, tells more lies, is a greater drudge, and gets less for his
pains than the merchant. The shoeblack piques himself upon giving
the last polish to a gentleman’s shoes, and gets a penny for his
trouble. In all these cases, it is not strictly the proportion between
the exertion and the object, neither hope nor fear in the abstract, that
determines the degree of our exertions, but the balance of our hopes
and fears, the <em>difference</em> that it will make to us in our situation whether
we exert ourselves to the utmost or not, and the impossibility of
turning our labour to any better account that habitually regulates our
conduct.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> We all do the best for ourselves that we can. This is at
least a general rule.—But let us suppose, though I do not think
Mr. Malthus has thrown any new or striking light on the way, in
which such a change would be brought about, that it is found necessary
to make a regular division of the land, and that a class of proprietors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and a class of labourers is consequently established. Let us see in
this case what proportion of the surplus produce of the ground might
be supposed to fall to the share of the labourer, or whether if any
thing more was allowed him than what was just enough to keep him
alive and enable him to stagger through the tasks of the day, both
rich and poor (but especially the latter) would not suffer grievously
from all such impious and inhuman attempts, as our author afterwards
calls them, to reverse the laws of nature, or decrees of Providence
(which you please) ‘by which some human beings are inevitably
exposed to want.’ I shall argue the question solely on the ground
stated by Mr. Malthus. I shall suppose that every proprietor has an
absolute right to his property, and to the <em>whole</em> produce of his own
exertions. There are two other questions to be considered, namely,
whether the right to the labour of others and to the produce of their
labour attaches to the possession of the soil, secondly, if that is not
the case, to what proportion of the produce of the ground the labourer
is naturally entitled by his exertions. Mr. Malthus infers that from
the establishment of the two fundamental laws, security of property,
and the institution of marriage, inequality of conditions must necessarily
follow. I confess I do not see this necessary consequence. I would
ask, upon what plea Mr. Malthus succeeded in establishing these two
fundamental laws, but because they were necessary and competent to
stimulate the exertions and restrain the passions of the community at
large, that is, to maintain a general practical equality, to regulate each
person’s indulgences according to their industry, to lay an even tax
upon every man, and thus prevent the return of fraud, violence,
confusion, want and misery. Grant that the most fatal effects would
result to society, if every man had a valid claim to <em>an equal share</em> of
the produce of the earth; it by no means follows that the same fatal
effects would result to society from allowing to every man a valid
claim to a share of the produce of the earth <em>proportioned</em> to his labour.
Yet I doubt whether any great inequality could subsist, while each
man had this valid claim. It is one thing to have a right to the
produce of your own exertions, and another to have a right to the
produce of the earth, that is, of the labour of others. It is so far
from being fair to apply the same reasoning to these two things, that
the evils which would be the necessary consequences of the one,
cannot possibly result from the other. The one is a direct contradiction
to the other. It is on this distinction in fact, that all property
and all society is originally founded. By making it equally the
interest of each individual to exert himself, you in all probability
secure an equal degree of industry and comfort in each individual.
At least, a society formed upon this plan would have as fair a chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of realising all the advantages of which it was capable, with as few
deviations from the original direction and design, as a society, where
only a less degree of equality was <em>possible</em>, would have of coming up
to its original idea. Industry and regularity of behaviour must gain
ground, where these habits were enforced by the general example of
the whole society, and where the sacrifice to be made was less, and
the reward more certain. I might appeal to the history of all
countries in proof of this. Industry flourishes most in those countries,
where there is the greatest equality of conditions, and where in
consequence instances of extreme distress can rarely occur. The
excessive depression of the lower class of the community can only
(by taking away the spring of hope, and making it nearly impossible
for them to fall lower,) dishearten industry, and make
them regardless of consequences. It cannot be laid down as an
axiom, that you animate industry, in proportion as you take away
its reward. It may be said that the poor will not go through
extreme hardships but from the fear of starving. I know no
reason why such hardships are necessary but because one man
is obliged to do the work of several.—These general observations
are not set aside by supposing the right of property to be established.
All that I can understand by a right of property is a right in any one
to cultivate a piece of land, be it more or less, and a right at the
same time to prevent any one else from cultivating it, or reaping the
produce. This, in whatever way a man comes by it, is the utmost
extent of this right. ‘Those who were born after the division of
property,’ says Mr. Malthus, ‘would come into <em>a world already
possessed</em>.’ [How the whole world should come to be possessed
immediately after the division of property I do not understand.] ‘If
their parents, from having too large a family, were unable to give
them sufficient for their support, what could they do in a world,
where every thing was appropriated?’ [Just now <em>the world</em>, and at
present, <em>every thing in it</em> is appropriated.] ‘We have seen the fatal
effects that would result to society, if every man had a valid claim to
an equal share of the produce of the earth.’ [This has been
answered.] ‘The members of a family which was grown too large
for the original division of land appropriated to it could not then
demand a part of the <em>surplus produce of others</em> as a debt of justice.’
[Certainly not. They would have no right to it, because one man
would have no right to another man’s property; but that right, as far
as relates to the surplus produce, is not backed by the necessity of
the case, as Mr. Malthus would lead us to suppose, or because every
thing is already appropriated.] ‘It has appeared that, from the
inevitable laws of human nature, some beings will be exposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>want.’ [That is the question.] ‘The number of those persons
would soon exceed the ability of the <em>surplus produce</em> to supply.’ I
believe so, if they depended on the surplus produce of the labour of
the rich to supply them. But the long and the short of it is that
these laborious landholders, these owners of surplus produce, finding
that their own exertions could not supply all their own wants, and at
the same time keep pace with their benevolence to those unhappy
persons, who in the great lottery of life had drawn a blank, would
call to their aid such of these as professed themselves able and willing
to exert their strength in procuring a <em>further surplus produce</em>, which
would enable the proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers,
that is, out of the produce of their own labour, not out of that of the
proprietors. To hear Mr. Malthus talk, one would suppose that
the rich were really a very hard-working, ill-used people, who are not
suffered to enjoy the earnings of their honest industry in quiet by a
set of troublesome, unsatisfied, luxurious, idle people called <em>the poor</em>.
Or one might suppose that a landed estate was a machine that did its
own work; or that it was like a large plum-cake, which the owner
might at once cut up into slices, and either eat them himself, or give
them away to others, just as he pleased. In this case I grant that
the poor might be said to depend entirely upon the bounty or <em>surplus
produce</em> of the rich; and as they would have no trouble in procuring
their share but merely that of asking for it, their demands would no
doubt be a little unreasonable, and in short, if they were complied
with, the estate, the surplus produce, or the plumb-cake (call it which
you will) would soon be gone. The question would no longer be
‘whether one man should give to another that which he did not use
himself: but whether he should give to his neighbour the food which
was absolutely necessary to his own existence.’ But I cannot admit
that they would be reduced to any such necessity merely from allowing
to the labourer as much of the additional produce of the ground
as he himself had really <em>added</em> to it. I repeat that I do not see how
a man’s reaping the produce, and no more than the produce of his
industry, can operate as an inducement to idleness, or to the excessive
multiplication of children, when notwithstanding all his industry it is
impossible he should provide for them without either diminishing his
own comforts, or if the population is already full, plunging them and
himself into want and misery. This addition to the argument is like
a foil to a sword—it prevents any dangerous consequences. If I say
to a number of people, that they may each of them have as much of a
heap of corn as they desire, the whole of it would very soon be
bespoke, but if I tell them that they may each of them have as much
as they can <em>carry away</em> themselves, there might be enough to load
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>them all, and I might have plenty left for my own consumption.
The ability and the willingness of a man to labour, (when these are
made the general foundation of his claim to the produce of the earth)
at once set bounds to his own rapacious demands, and effectually
limit the population.—If Mr. Malthus had shewn that nothing but
extreme misery can excite to industry or check population, he would
then have shewn the necessity of such a state. But if it has appeared
in various ways that there is no connection between these things, or
that if there is, it is directly contrary to what Mr. Malthus supposes
it, then he has failed in his attempt to regulate the price of labour by
the principle of population, or to prove that this should be fixed so
low, as only just to keep the labourer from starving. Certainly any
advance in the price of labour, or a more equal distribution of the
produce of the earth would enable a greater number of persons to live
in comfort, and would increase population; but it is the height of
absurdity, as I have shewn over and over again, to suppose that it
would lead to an excessive or unrestricted increase; as if by making
people acquainted with comfort and decency, you were teaching them
to fall in love with misery. This is the real jut and bearing of the
question. The author of the Essay, to assist his argument, transposes
the question. He represents the labouring class of the community as
a set of useless, supernumerary paupers, living on charity, or on the
labour of the industrious proprietor. If this representation had any
foundation, I should be ready to admit that these interlopers had no
claim on any part of <em>the surplus produce of others as a debt of justice</em>.
They must owe every thing to favour, and would be entirely at the
mercy of their benefactors. Every reader must perceive, how little
this account is in any degree near the truth. The case is not that of
a person both willing and able to labour for himself, and imparting
freely to another, who had done nothing to deserve it, a part of the
surplus produce of the soil, but of a person bargaining with another to
do all his work for him, and allowing him as a bribe part of the
produce of his own labour in return. It is not therefore a question of
right any more than it is a question of expediency, but a question of
power on one side, and of necessity on the other. On the degree of
power, or on that of the necessity, and on nothing else, will the price
of labour depend. Mr. Malthus somewhere talks of a man’s having
no right to subsistence when his labour will not <em>fairly</em> purchase it.
This word <em>fairness</em> conveys to my ears no meaning but that of the
struggle between power and want, just spoken of. ‘A man,’ he says,
‘born into a world already possessed, if the society do not want his
labour, has no claim of <em>right</em> to the smallest portion of food.’ This
is, as if the question was of an individual, pestering a laborious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>community for a job, when they do not want his assistance, and not
of the laborious part of the community demanding a small portion of
food or the means of subsistence out of the surplus produce of their
labour as <em>a fair compensation</em> for their trouble! I sometimes think
that abstruse subjects are best illustrated by familiar examples, and I
shall accordingly give one. Suppose I have got possession of an
island which I either took from somebody else, or was the first to
occupy. But no matter how I came by it, I am in possession of it,
and that is enough. Suppose then I see another person coming
towards it either in a canoe (these questions are always first decided
in a state very nearly approaching a state of nature) or swimming
from some other island as I conceive either with intent to drive me
from it, or to defraud me of the produce of my labour. Now even
allowing that I had more than enough for myself, that part of my
surplus produce was devoured by fowls or wild beasts, or that I
threw it for sport into the sea, yet I should contend that I have a
right, a strict right in one sense of the word, to take out a long pole,
and push this unfair intruder from the shore, and try to sink his boat
or himself in the water to get rid of him, and defend my own <em>right</em>.
But suppose that instead of his coming to me, I go to him, and
persuade him to return with me; and that when I have got him
home, I want to set him to work to do either part or the whole of
my business for me. In this case I should conceive that he is at
liberty either to work or refuse working just as he thinks proper, to
work on what terms he thinks proper, to receive only a small part, or
the half, or more than half the produce as he pleases; or if I do not
chuse to agree to his terms, I must do my work myself. What
possible right have I over him? His right to his liberty is just as
good as my right to my property. It is an excellent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i>,
and if he is as idle as I am lazy, he will make his market of it. I
say then that this original right continues in all stages of society,
unless where it has been specifically given up; and acts as a counterpoise
to the insolence of property. If indeed the poor will work for
the rich at a certain rate, they are not bound to employ others who
demand higher wages, or a greater number than they want: but as
it is plain that they must either work themselves, or get others to
work for them, over whom they have no right whatever, I contend
that the mass of the labouring community have always a right to
<em>strike</em>, to demand what wages they please; the least that they can
demand is enough to support them and their families; and the real
contest will be between the aversion of the rich to labour, and of the
poor to famine. This seems to be the philosophy of the question.
It is also the spirit of the laws of England, which have left a provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>for the poor; wisely considering, no doubt, that they who received
their all from the labour of others were bound to provide out of their
superfluities for the necessities of such as were in want. If it be said
that this principle will lead to extreme abuse in practice, I answer,
No, for there is hardly any one, who will live in dependence, or on
casualties, if he can help it. The check to the abuse is sufficiently
provided in the miserable precariousness and disgusting nature of the
remedy. But if from the extreme inequality of conditions, that is,
from one part of the community having been able to engross all the
advantages of society to themselves, so that they can trample on the
others at pleasure, the poor are reduced so low in intellect and feeling
as to be indifferent to every consideration of the kind, neither will
they be restrained from following their inclinations by Mr. Malthus’s
grinding law of necessity, by the abolition of the poor laws, or by the
prospect of seeing their children starving at the doors of the rich. It
is not by their own fault alone that they have fallen into this degradation;
those who have brought them into it ought to be answerable for
some of the consequences. The way to obviate those consequences
is not by obstinately increasing the pressure, but by lessening it. It
is not my business to inquire how a society formed upon the simple
plan above-mentioned might be supposed to degenerate in consequence
of the different passions, follies, vices, and circumstances of mankind,
into a state of excessive inequality and wretchedness: it is sufficient
for my purpose to have shewn, that such a change was not rendered
necessary by the sole principle of population, or that it would not be
absolutely impossible for a state of actual equality to last ‘thirty years’
without producing the total overthrow and destruction of the society.
Equality produces no such maddening effects on the principle of
population, nor is it a thing, any approaches to which must be fatal to
human happiness, and are universally to be dreaded. The connection
therefore between that degree of inequality, which terminates in
extreme vice and misery, and the necessary restraints on population,
is not so obvious or indissoluble, as to give Mr. Malthus a right to
‘qualify’ the luxuries of the rich, and the distresses of the poor as the
inevitable consequences of the fundamental laws of nature, and as necessary
to the very existence of society. I shall here take the liberty of
quoting the two following passages from Mr. Malthus’s Essay, which
seem exactly to confirm my ideas on the subject, only better expressed,
and stated in a much neater manner. ‘In most countries, among the
lower classes of people, there appears to be something like a standard of
wretchedness, a point below which, they will not continue to marry and
propagate their species. This standard is different in different countries,
and is formed by various concurring circumstances of soil, climate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>government, degree of knowledge, and civilization, &amp;c. The principal
circumstances which contribute to raise it, are, liberty, security of
property, the spread of knowledge, and <em>a taste for the conveniences and
the comforts of life</em>. Those which contribute principally to lower it
are despotism and ignorance.’ For what purpose did Mr. Malthus
write his book? ‘In an attempt to better the condition of the lower
classes of society, our object should be to raise this standard as high
as possible, by cultivating a spirit of independence, a decent pride,
and a taste for cleanliness and comfort among the poor. These
habits would be best inculcated by a system of general education and,
when strongly fixed, would be <em>the most powerful means of preventing
their marrying with the prospect of being obliged to forfeit such advantages;
and would consequently raise them nearer to the middle classes of society</em>.’
Yet Mr. Malthus elsewhere attempts to prove that the pressure of
population on the means of subsistence can only be kept back by a
system of terror and famine, as the pressure of a crowd is only kept
back by the soldiers’ bayonets. I have thus endeavoured to answer
the <em>play of words</em>, by which Mr. Malthus undertakes to prove that
the rich have an absolute right to the disposal of the whole of the
surplus produce of <em>the labour of others</em>. After this preparation, I
shall venture to trust the reader’s imagination with the passages, in
which he tries to put down private charity, and to prove the right of
the rich (whenever they conveniently can) to starve the poor. They
are very pretty passages.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There is one right, which man has generally been thought to
possess, which I am confident he neither does, nor can, possess, a
right to subsistence when his labour will not <em>fairly</em> purchase it. Our
laws indeed say, that he has this right, and bind the society to
furnish employment and food to those who cannot get them in the
regular market; but in so doing, they attempt to reverse the laws
of nature; and it is, in consequence, to be expected, not only that
they should fail in their object, but that the poor who were intended
to be benefited, should suffer most cruelly from this inhuman deceit
which is practised upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot
get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and
if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of <em>right</em> to the
smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he
is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him.
She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders,
if he do not work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If
these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately
appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order
and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned
is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed
by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall,
and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged
at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect.
The guests learn too late their error, in counteracting those strict
orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who,
wishing that all her guests should have plenty, and knowing that she
could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit
fresh comers when her table was already full.’ This is a very
brilliant description, and a pleasing allegory. Our author luxuriates
in the dearth of nature: he cannot contain his triumph: he frolics
with his subject in the gaiety of his heart, and his tongue grows
wanton in praise of famine. But let us examine it not as a display
of imagination, but as a piece of reasoning. In the first place, I
cannot admit the assertion that ‘at nature’s mighty feast there is no
vacant cover for the poor man.’ There are plenty of vacant covers
but that the guests at the head of the table have seized upon all
those at the lower end, before the table was full. Or if there were
no vacant cover, it would be no great matter, he only asks for the
crumbs which fall from rich men’s tables, and the bones which
they throw to their dogs. ‘She (nature) tells him to be gone, and
will quickly execute her own orders, if he do not work on the
compassion of some of the guests.’ When I see a poor old man,
who after a life of unceasing labour is obliged at last to beg his
bread, driven from the door of the rich man by a surly porter, and
half a dozen sleek well-fed dogs, kept for the pleasure of their master
or mistress, jumping up from the fireside, or bouncing out of their
warm kennels upon him, I am, according to Mr. Malthus, in the
whole of this scene, to fancy nature presiding in person and executing
her own orders against this unwelcome intruder, who as he is bent
fairly double with hard labour, and can no longer get employment
in the regular market, has no claim of <em>right</em> (as our author emphatically
expresses it) to the smallest portion of food, and in fact has no
business to be where he is. The preference which is often given to
the inferior animals over the human species by the institutions and
customs of society is bad enough. But Mr. Malthus wishes to go
farther. By the institutions of society a rich man is at liberty to give
his superabundance either to the poor or to his dogs. Mr. Malthus
will not allow him this liberty, but says that by the laws of nature
he is bound to give it to his dogs, because if we suffer the poor to
work upon our compassion at all, this will only embolden their importunity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>‘and the order and harmony that before reigned at nature’s
feast will be disturbed and changed into want and confusion.’ This
might probably be the consequence, if the rich, or the chief guests
had provided the entertainment for themselves; or if nature, like a
liberal hostess, had kindly provided it for them, at her own proper
cost and expence, without any obligations to the poor. It might be
necessary in this case for those who had either provided the feast,
or been expressly invited to it, to keep a pretty strict hand over those
idle and disorderly persons, to whose importunity there was no end.
But the question really is, not whether all those should be supplied
who press forward into the hall without having contributed any thing
to the plenty that abounds, but whether after the different guests
have contributed largely, each of them having brought his share and
more than his share, the proprietors of the mansion have a right to
turn them all out again, and only leave a few scraps or coarse bits to
be flung to them out of the windows, or handed to them outside the
door. Or whether if every man was allowed to eat the <em>mess</em> which
he had brought with him in quiet, he would immediately go out, and
bring in half a dozen more, so that he would have nothing left for
himself, and the hall would be instantly overcrowded. This statement
is, I believe, considerably nearer the truth than Mr. Malthus’s.
And if so, we can have little difficulty in deciding whether there is
any ground for Mr. Malthus’s apprehensions of the danger of raising
the condition of the poor, or relieving the distresses to which, in
their present unnatural and unnecessary state of degradation, they are
unavoidably subject. ‘The spectacle of misery and dependence’
never arises from the scantiness of the provision, or from the nearly
equal shares, in which it is divided, giving encouragement to a greater
number of applicants; for those helpless intruders, against whom
Mr. Malthus issues such strict orders, namely the <em>rising generation</em>,
never come into the world till they are sent for, and it is not likely
that those who find themselves warm in their seats with every thing
comfortable about them and nothing to complain of, should when
there is really no room for fresh comers, send for more people to
shove them out of their places, and eat the victuals out of their
mouths. ‘The Abbé Raynal has said that, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avant toutes les loix
sociales l’homme avoit le droit de subsister</span>.” He might with just as
much propriety have said, that before the institution of social laws,
every man had a right to live a hundred years. Undoubtedly he had
then, and has still, a good right to live a hundred years, nay a thousand
<em>if he can</em>, without interfering with <em>the right of others to live</em>; but the
affair, in both cases, is principally an affair of power, not of right.
Social laws very greatly increase this power, by enabling a much greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>number to subsist than could subsist without them, and so far very
greatly enlarge <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le droit de subsister</span></i>; but neither before nor after the
institution of social laws, could <em>an unlimited number subsist</em>; and before,
as well as since, he who ceased to have <em>the power</em>, ceased to have <em>the
right</em>.’ In this passage Mr. Malthus ‘sharpens his understanding
upon his flinty heart.’ The logic is smart and lively and unembarrassed:
it is not encumbered with any of the awkward feelings
of humanity. After all, he misses his aim. For his argument
proves that the right of subsistence or one man’s right to live is
only limited by its interfering with the right of others to live: that is,
that a man has then only no right to live, when there is nothing for
him to live upon; in which case the question becomes an affair of
power, not of right. But it is not the question whether the proprietor
should starve himself in order that the labourer may live; but whether
the proprietor has a right to live in extravagance and luxury, while
the labourer is starving. As to his absolute right to the produce of
the soil, that is to say, of the labour of others, we have seen that he
has no such right either to the whole of the surplus produce, or to
<em>as much of it as he pleases</em>. With respect then to the share of the
produce which the labourer has a right to demand, ‘it is not likely
that he should exchange his labour, without receiving a <em>sufficient</em>
quantity of food in return,’ to enable him to live, unless the right
of the proprietor to exact the labour of others on what terms he
chuses, is seconded by a kind of power, which has very little connection
with the power of the earth to bring forth no more produce.
As to the right of the rich, in a moral point of view, wantonly to
starve the poor, it is I think best to say nothing about it. Social
institutions, on which our author lays great stress as enlarging the
power of subsistence and the right along with it, do not deny relief
to the poor. For this very reason Mr. Malthus wishes to shoulder
them aside, in order to make room for certain regulations of his own,
more agreeable to <em>the laws of nature and the principle of population</em>.
A little farther on he says, ‘As a previous step even to any considerable
alteration in the present system, which would <em>contract</em> or stop the
increase of the relief to be given, it appears to me that we are bound
in justice and honour ‘<em>formally to disclaim the right of the poor to
support</em>.’ It would be more modest in Mr. Malthus to let them
<em>disclaim</em> it for themselves. But it appears that the reason for
<em>contracting</em> the relief afforded them by the present system, and
denying the right altogether, is that there is no subsistence for an
unlimited number. As to the point at which it may be prudent or
proper for the rich to withhold assistance from the poor, I shall not
enquire into it. But I shall dispute Mr. Malthus’s right to thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the poor man out of existence because there is no room for him
‘at nature’s mighty feast,’ till he can give some better reason for it
than that there is not room for an <em>unlimited number</em>!—The maintainance
of the needy poor is a tax on the inequality of conditions and
the luxuries of the rich, which they could not enjoy but in consequence
of that general depression of the lower classes which continually
subjects them to difficulties and want. It is a <em>douceur</em> to keep them
quiet, and prevent them from enforcing those more solid, and important
claims, not interfering with the right of property, but a direct
consequence of the right of personal freedom, and of their right to set
their own price on their own exertions, which would raise them above
the reach of want, and enable them to maintain their own <em>poor</em>. But
they cannot do this without a general combination of the labouring part
of the community; and if any thing of this kind were to be attempted,
the legislature we know would instantly interfere to prevent it. I know
indeed that the legislature assumes a right to prevent combinations of the
poor to keep themselves above want, though they <em>disclaim</em> any right to
meddle with monopolies of corn, or other combinations <em>in the regular
course of trade</em>, by which the rich and thriving endeavour to grind the
poor. But though the men of property have thus retained the legislature
on their side, Mr. Malthus does not think this practical security sufficient:
he thinks it absolutely necessary to recur to first principles; and that
they may see how well qualified he is to act as chamber counsel in
the business, he makes them a present of his Essay, written expressly
for the purpose, and containing a new institute of the laws of nature,
and a complete theory of population, in which it is clearly proved that
the poor have no right to live any longer than the rich will let
them. In this work which those to whom it is addressed should
have bound in morocco, and constantly lying by them as a text-book
to refer to in all cases of difficulty, it is shewn that there is no
injustice in forcing the poorer classes to work almost for nothing,
because they have no right to the produce of their labour, and no
inhumanity in denying them assistance when they happen to be in
want, because they ought not to be encouraged in idleness. Thus
armed with ‘metaphysical aid,’ and conscience-proof, the rich will I
should think be able very successfully to resist the unjust claims of
the poor—to a subsistence!</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither the fundamental laws of property then, nor the principle of
population seem to imply the necessity of any great inequality of
conditions. They do not even require the distinction of rich and
poor, much less do they imply the right of the rich to starve the
poor. What shews that there must be some radical defect in our
author’s reasoning is, that a substantial equality does really prevail in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>several countries, where the right of property is established, and where
the <em>principle of population</em> has been known to exist for a great length of
time. Property may certainly be made a handle for power; and that
power may, and does almost constantly lead to abuse, I mean to want
and wretchedness. But neither the power nor the abuse is any part
of the original right; and the original end and design of the right
itself, namely to procure a sufficient supply for the actual population,
and to prevent an unlimited increase of population, is just as well, or
indeed much better answered <em>without</em>, than <em>with</em> the abuse.—But
perhaps we have mistaken Mr. Malthus all this while. Perhaps he
only wishes to secure to the rich their original right, which is to
reserve a certain share of the produce for their own use; and to
prevent their being driven out of house and home by the poor, under
pretence of population. He seems to say in one place, that the fund
appropriated to the maintenance of labour is the aggregate quantity of
food possessed by the owners of land beyond what is necessary for
their own immediate consumption. He says this, or something like
it. In this case, it is evident, that ‘no man would be forced to
exchange his labour without receiving an ample quantity of food in
return.’ At this rate the labourer would be as rich, only not so idle
as the proprietor. The only difference between them would be that
one of them would get his share for nothing, and the other would be
obliged to work for it. It would in fact be a common fund divided
equally between the rich and poor, or more properly speaking,
between the sleeping and the acting partners in this joint-concern. If
so, I do not see what the poor could have to complain of, as, if they
were ever in want, it must be owing to their own idleness, extravagance,
and imprudence, and they would deserve to be punished.
Now Mr. Malthus is ready to prove with a pair of compasses that this
is always the state of the case. The poor are always just as well off
as the rich, if it is not their own fault, and the want in which they
are sometimes plunged is not owing to an unequal division of the
shares among as many as can possibly subsist, but to the folly of
pushing population beyond the verge of subsistence. By this means
there is nothing left for those who come last, who have consequently
no right to be where they are, because there is nothing for them.
‘The quantity of food’ (says Mr. Malthus) ‘which one man can
consume is necessarily limited by the narrow capacity of the human
stomach; it is not certainly probable that he should throw away the
rest; and if he exchange his surplus produce for the labour of others,
this is better than that these others should absolutely starve.’ Here
then we see the necessary limits of the inequality of conditions, or of
the almost imperceptible difference in the advantages which the rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>have over the poor. But is there really then no difference between
being gorged and <em>not</em> being starved, between eating venison and turtle-soup,
and drinking three bottles of wine a-day, and living on crusts of
bread and water? Is it physically impossible that one man should
eat more than does him good, or that another should not get his full
share? But it may be asked, what advantage can it be to the rich to
consume more than they want? None. But the food which is thus
misapplied, might be of great use to the poor. Is there no such
thing as waste in great houses, which must considerably diminish the
disproportion between the quantity of food, and the narrow capacity
of the human stomach? When I consider that the rich are neither a
bit taller, nor stouter, nor born with larger stomachs than other men,
it does indeed seem at first sight a little extraordinary that they should
make such havoc in the world as they do. But the wonder vanishes
the instant we recollect that crowd of dependents always dangling
about them, who intercept the surplus produce long before it can reach
the labourer, and who instead of dividing his toil with the husbandman,
or sharing in other tasks not less useful or necessary are
maintained by the distresses and hardships of the poor. A rich man
has not only himself and his family to keep, but he has to keep his
gentlemen, his valet, his butler, his cook, his coachman, his groom,
his horses, his hounds, his ornamental gardener, his architect, his
upholsterer, his jeweller, his silversmith, his man’s-mercer, and haberdasher,
his pimps, parasites, and players, his poets, painters, and
musicians, not to mention a hundred more, who are of no service on
the face of the earth, nor have any mortal thing to do—but to tend
upon his person, to dress his hair, to brush his clothes, or air his shirt,
to run on his errands, to do his jobs, to manage his affairs, to please
his taste, to pamper his appetites, to study his humours, to follow his
steps, to fawn and cringe and bow and smile as he directs. All these
persons depend entirely on the bounty of their patron; and though
they do nothing to increase the produce of the ground, they do not
devour it the less eagerly, and it may be supposed that they make a
good gap in it. In the mean time, the productive labourer, and hard-working
mechanic are straitened in their circumstances, and doomed
to unremitting toil and drudgery, that these hangers-on of the rich
may live at their ease, or contribute only to the vanity and convenience
of their employers. This as I understand it is the pinch of
the grievance.—The rich man has not only to supply his own wants,
but the wants of those who depend upon him, and who do nothing to
support either him or themselves. He is something in the situation
of a balance-master, who undertakes to support twenty men, some on
his head, some on his shoulders, and others suspended from different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>parts of his body: his own weight is nothing: it is the weight of
those who hang upon him that makes the rich man a burthen to the
poor. I see a little old emaciated man riding on a poney along the
street, and a stout healthy, well looking man riding behind him at
some distance, who follows him like his puppet, who turns as he turns,
and whenever he passes him touches his hat in a respectful manner.
What is the meaning of this? It is a nobleman, and his servant.
The man is as well-fed, as comfortably clothed, and as well-mounted
as his master: what makes all the difference is, that there are thirty
or forty gradations of society between them, each looking up with
envy, or down with contempt on the other, as they have more or less
power over the necessaries and conveniences of life not for themselves,
but others, and so can hire the respect of a certain number of
dependents. So little can we judge of the state of society in the
mechanical way pointed out by Mr. Malthus. But it is time to
proceed with my author.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘As Mr. Godwin seems disposed to understand, and candidly to
admit the truth of, the principal argument in the essay, I feel the
more mortified, that he should think it a fair inference from my
positions, that the political superintendents of a community are bound
to exercise a paternal vigilance and care over the two great means of
advantage and safety to mankind, misery and vice; and that no evil
is more to be dreaded than that we should have too little of them in
the world, to confine the principle of population within its proper
sphere.’ [This I think a fair statement of the argument.] ‘I am at
a loss to conceive what class of evils Mr. Godwin imagines is yet
behind, which these salutary checks are to prevent.’ [It is not Mr.
Godwin’s business, but our author’s to find out such a class of evils.]
‘For my own part, I know of no stronger or more general terms
than vice and misery; and the sole question is, respecting a greater
or less degree of them. The only reason why I object to Mr.
Godwin’s system, is, my full conviction that an attempt to execute
it, would very greatly increase the quantity of vice and misery in
society.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Be it so. But still Mr. Malthus thinks a less degree of them
necessary to prevent a greater; and it therefore seems a fair inference
from his positions to say, that the greatest care ought to be taken, not
to diminish the necessary quantity. He approves much of the things in
his own mind, but he does not like to hear them called by their names
in a disrespectful way. He does not like the odium attached to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Mr. Godwin observes, that he should naturally be disposed to
pronounce that man strangely indifferent to schemes of extraordinary
improvement in society, who made it a conclusive argument against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>them, that, when they were realized, they might peradventure
be of no permanence and duration. And yet, what is morality,
individual or political, according to Mr. Godwin’s own definition of
it, but a calculation of consequences?’ [This, I must say, is a very
<em>abortive</em> kind of argument]. ‘Is the physician the patron of pain,
who advises his patient to bear a present evil, rather than betake himself
to a remedy, which, though it might give momentary relief, would
afterwards greatly aggravate all the symptoms?’ [The real case is
of a physician, who tells his patient he must not get well, and
endeavours to keep him from doing so, because if he were once in
perfect health, he would be subject to more violent returns of his
disorder]. ‘Is the moralist to be called an enemy to pleasure,
because he recommends to a young man just entering into life, not to
ruin his health and patrimony in a few years, by an excess of present
gratifications, but to economize his enjoyments, that he may spread
them over a longer period?’ [Our Essayist would advise the young
man to neglect his affairs, and ruin his health, because by a contrary
method his estate would increase so that he would not be able to
manage it, and it would be thrown into complete and total disorder,
at the same time that his improved health and spirits would urge him
to plunge into much greater excesses, than, if his constitution were
debilitated in time, he would be capable of committing]. ‘Of Mr.
Godwin’s system, according to the present arguments by which it is
supported, it is not enough to say, <em>peradventure</em> it will be of no
permanence: but we can pronounce <em>with certainty</em> that it will be of no
permanence: and under such circumstances an attempt to execute it
would unquestionably be a great political immorality.’ According
to the <em>present</em> arguments against it, this has not appeared to be the
case.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The permission of infanticide is bad enough, and cannot but have
a bad effect on the moral sensibility of a nation; but I cannot conceive
any thing much more detestable, or shocking to the feelings, than
any direct regulation of this kind, although sanctioned by the names
of Plato and Aristotle.’ Mr. Malthus in this passage very properly
gives way to his feelings, which are, in my opinion, a much better
test of morality than a calculation of consequences. At the same
time, he would himself make a law to starve the children of the poor,
because their parents are not able to maintain them. Mr. Malthus’s
humanity is of the <em>intermittent</em> sort. The mention of the Chinese, of
Plato or Aristotle, has a great effect in bringing the fit on: at the
mention of population or the poor-laws it vanishes in an instant, and
‘he is himself again.’—I hope I shall sometimes be allowed to appeal
to my feelings against Mr. Malthus’s authority, as he dissents from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>that of Plato and Aristotle on the same <em>unphilosophical</em> plea, and to
look upon those arguments as narrow and superficial, which pay no
regard to ‘the moral sensibility of a nation’; the more so as the
system of morality prevailing at present is built upon the natural
affections and common feelings and habitual prejudices of mankind,
not, as Mr. Malthus pretends, on pure reason, or a dry calculation of
consequences. Our author’s plan is addressed neither to the <em>head</em>,
nor <em>heart</em>. It retains the common sympathies of our nature only to
shock and insult them, and engrafts the vices of a bad heart on a
perverted understanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus defies Mr. Godwin to point out a method, by which
it is possible ‘to limit the number of children to each prolific
marriage.’ According to his theory, there seems no way but by
having a constable in the room, and converting bed-chambers into a
kind of lock-up houses.—Speaking of the possibility of delaying the
gratification of the passion between the sexes, he says,</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If the whole effect were to depend merely on a sense of duty,
considering the powerful antagonist that is to be contended with, in
the present case, I confess that I should absolutely despair. At the
same time, I am strongly of opinion that a sense of duty, superadded
to a sense of interest, would by no means be without its effect.
There are many noble and disinterested spirits, who, though aware
of the inconveniences which they may bring upon themselves by the
indulgence of an early and virtuous passion, feel a kind of repugnance
to listen to the dictates of mere worldly prudence, and a pride in
rejecting these low considerations. There is a kind of romantic
gallantry in sacrificing all for love, naturally fascinating to a young
mind; and, to say the truth, if all is to be sacrificed, I do not know,
in what better cause it can be done. But if a strong sense of duty
could, in these instances, be added to prudential suggestions, the
whole question might wear a different colour. In delaying the
gratification of passion, from a sense of duty, the most disinterested
spirit, the most delicate honour, might be satisfied. The romantic
pride might take a different direction, and the dictates of worldly
prudence might be followed with the cheerful consciousness of
making a virtuous sacrifice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>I am happy to learn that Mr. Malthus has been able to reconcile
the sense of duty and interest with the gratification of his favourite
passion. By preaching the virtue of celibacy with such success to
others, he found it no longer necessary to practise it himself. He is
not the first philosopher who extracted the flames of love out of ice.
We read of such a one in Hudibras. I should be sorry to scandalize
the modest reader; but really whenever I think of our author’s escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>from the consequences of his own doctrine in a wife, it puts me in
mind of St. Francis’s triumph over his desires,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Which after in enjoyment quenching,</div>
      <div class='line'>He hung a garland on his engine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This St. Francis was as great an adept as our author in the cold-sweat
of the passions.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no end of Mr. Malthus’s paradoxes. I come now to his
attempts to prove that in proportion as you raise the wages of the
poor, you take away their livelihood.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Suppose, that by a subscription of the rich, the eighteen-pence, or
two shillings, which men earn now, were made up five shillings, it
might be imagined, perhaps, that they would then be able to live
comfortably, and have a piece of meat every day for their dinner.
But this would be a very false conclusion. The transfer of three
additional shillings a day to each labourer would not increase the
quantity of meat in the country. There is not at present enough for
all to have a moderate share. What would then be the consequence?
The competition among the buyers in the market of meat, would
rapidly raise the price from eight pence or nine pence, to two or
three shillings in the pound, and the commodity would not be
divided among many more than it is at present. When an article is
scarce, and cannot be distributed to all, he that can shew the most
valid patent, that is, he that offers the most money, becomes the
possessor. When subsistence is scarce in proportion to the number
of people, it is of little consequence, whether the lowest members
of the society possess two shillings or five. They must, at all
events, be reduced to live upon the hardest fare, and in the smallest
quantity.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, some pages after he says, ‘The question is, how far wealth
has a tendency to better the condition of the labouring poor. It is
a self-evident proposition that any general advance in the price of
labour, the stock of provisions remaining the same, can only be a
nominal advance, as it must shortly be followed by a <em>proportional</em> rise
in provisions. The increase in the price of labour which we have
supposed, would have no permanent effect therefore in giving to the
labouring poor a greater command over the necessaries of life.’</p>

<p class='c011'>On these two passages which explain the drift of our author’s
reasonings pretty clearly, I shall remark, first, that wealth is nothing
but the power of securing to yourself the fruits of the earth, or
commanding the labour of others. The more equal distribution of
wealth, or the throwing a greater quantity of money (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i>) into
the hands of the poor must therefore enable them to procure either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>a greater share of provisions or of the labour of others, or both.
This I hold to be an axiom, as far as I can comprehend the subject.
But Mr. Malthus says that if the wages of the poor were raised to
double or treble what they are at present, this in the first place
would not increase the quantity of meat in the market, nor the share
which the labourer would have of it, because any advance in the
price of labour must be followed by a <em>proportional</em> rise in provisions.
This word is equivocal. To make out the argument, the rise ought
to be not only proportional but equal to the rise of wages, which it
evidently would not be. But Mr. Malthus is willing to exclude
the possibility of bettering the condition of the poor, even in theory,
by an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">equivoque</span></i>, or any thing else. But to put an end to this
miserable quackery, I would ask, whether if the rich were to divide
their incomes with the poor, the latter would be any the richer for
it. To say in this case, that the good things of the world would
not be shared more equally among them, is flat nonsense. But
any approach to a more equal division of wealth must lessen the
difference between the rich and the poor <em>proportionally</em>. It is true
that the lowest members of the community will still live upon the
hardest fare, and in the smallest quantity: but their fare will be less
hard and in larger quantities than it used to be, <em>in proportion</em> to the
advance in the price of labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It may at first appear strange, but I believe it is true, that I
cannot by means of money, raise the condition of a poor man, and
enable him to live much better than he did before, without proportionably
depressing others in the same class. If I retrench the
quantity of food consumed in my house, and give him what I have
cut off, I then benefit him without depressing any but myself and
family, who perhaps may be well able to bear it. If I turn up a
piece of uncultivated land, and give him the produce, I then benefit
both him and all the members of society, because what he before
consumed is thrown into the common stock, and, probably, some of
the new produce with it. But if I only give him money, supposing
the produce of the country to remain the same, I give him a title to
a larger share of that produce than formerly, which share he cannot
receive without diminishing the shares of others. It is evident, that
this effect in individual instances must be so small as to be totally
imperceptible; but still it must exist, as many other effects do, which,
like some of the insects that people the air, elude our grosser perceptions.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be sufficient to ask in answer to this passage, whether when
I give away my money to another, I do not necessarily retrench the
quantity of food or other things consumed in my own house, and give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>him what I have cut off. I give him a title to a larger share of the
common produce by diminishing <em>my own</em> share. It does not matter
to the community whether he or I spend the money: the only
difference that it makes is between ourselves.—Mr. Malthus seems
to have a notion that the rich are never the worse for their charities.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Supposing the quantity of food in any country, to remain the same
for many years together, it is evident, that this food must be divided
according to the value of each man’s patent, or the sum of money
which he can afford to spend in this commodity so universally in
request. It is a demonstrative truth, therefore, that the patents of
one set of men could not be increased in value, without diminishing
the value of the patents of some other set of men.’</p>

<p class='c011'>At any rate, then, the poor would be enabled to contend with
the rich. The increased value of the patents of the poor would
necessarily diminish the value of the patents of the rich. In order
to out-bid them, they must make some other sacrifices, which they
will not always be willing to do. Food to the rich is in a great
measure an article of luxury: to the poor it is a necessary; and the
one, about which they are chiefly concerned. Many a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maître</span></i>,
and ape of fashion goes without his dinner to pay for his coat, or go
to the play, ‘where he picks clean teeth,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No person, I believe, will venture to doubt, that, if we were to
give three additional shillings a day to every labouring man in the
kingdom, as I before supposed, in order that he might have meat for
his dinner, the price of meat would rise in the most rapid and unexampled
manner.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus here creeps on. He first spoke of a number of
individuals as having a certain sum given them. He now includes
every labouring man in the kingdom. Because if we were to give
five shillings a day to five hundred thousand men, the remaining five
hundred thousand might be the worse for it, therefore he would have
us suppose that the same or greater mischiefs would follow from
giving the same sum to the whole number, or in fact from doing
away that very inequality, which was the only source of the mischief.
To suppose that we can allow five shillings a-day to five hundred, or
ten hundred thousand people without retrenching from our own
superfluities, or that we can distribute our own patents among others
without diminishing our own number, is one of those perversities
which I shall not attempt to answer. If the labourer with his three
shillings extra is only able to purchase an ounce of meat, this will
be an advantage to him. Let the rise be what it will, the rich man
will evidently be less able to out-bid him than he is at present, and
the rise can only be in proportion to his capacity to out-bid him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Besides, it is not to be supposed that his additional gains would all
be laid out in meat, but in articles of trade, &amp;c. which would be
rendered cheaper by the neglect of the rich, or in proportion to the
run upon provisions. To assert generally that increasing the wages
of the poor does not give them a greater command over the
necessaries of life, is as much as to say that if they were forced to
work for nothing, and could get nothing to eat, this would lower the
markets, and they would be much better off than they were before.
It would be looked upon as an insult, rather than a consolation, to
tell them that they ought to be contented with the cheapness of
provisions, and to consider that allowing them any thing for their
labour, would only raise the price of meat by enabling them to buy
some of it to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p class='c011'>How things being cheap or dear, or how there being much or little
to spare, proves that that much, or little will not be divided according
to the ability of different people to pay for it, is beyond my
comprehension. It is ridiculous. It is saying that the money of a
poor man will not <em>pass</em>, even when he has it. If the poor in consequence
of having more money, or being richer could not draw to
themselves a greater portion of food, there could be no room for
competition, nor for an increase in the price or the demand.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The poor who were assisted by their parishes had no reason
whatever to complain of the high price of grain; because it was the
excessiveness of this price, and this alone, which, by enforcing such
a saving, left a greater quantity of corn, for the consumption of the
lowest classes, which corn, the parish allowances enabled them to
command.’ [Yet Mr. Malthus has just tried to persuade us, that the
increased price of provisions, occasioned by the competition of the
poor, does not enforce any retrenchment of the superfluities of
the higher classes, or leave a greater quantity of corn, for the consumption
of the lower classes.] ‘The greatest sufferers in the
scarcity were undoubtedly the classes immediately above the poor;
and these were in the most marked manner depressed by the excessive
bounties given to those below them.’ [It is better that these classes
should be depressed than those below them, because they can bear it
better. Is it an argument that because the pressure of a scarcity does
not fall directly upon those who can bear it best, viz. the very rich,
that it should therefore fall upon those, who can bear it least, viz. on
the very poor? Unless Mr. Malthus can contrive to starve some
one, he thinks he does nothing.] ‘This distribution by giving to the
poorer classes a command of food, so much greater than their degree
of skill and industry entitled them to, in the actual circumstances of
the country, diminished, exactly in the same proportion, that command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>over the necessaries of life, which the classes above them, by
their superior skill and industry, would naturally possess.’ [Is a man
then to starve on account of his want of skill? To tack industry to
skill as if the lowest classes did not work the hardest is impudence
indeed.] ‘And it may be a question, whether the degree of assistance
which the poor received, and which prevented them from resorting
to the use of those substitutes, which, in every other country, on such
occasions, the great law of necessity teaches, was not more than overbalanced
by the severity of the pressure on so large a body of people
from the extreme high prices, and the permanent evil which must
result from forcing so many persons on the parish, who before thought
themselves almost out of the reach of want.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a contradiction to say, that the poor were forced on the parish
by the assistance they received from it. If they were to be denied
this assistance from a tender regard for their morals and independence,
it is a pity that the same disinterested motives, joined to the ‘severe
pressure’ of the high prices on the classes above the poor, did not
induce some of <em>them</em> to condescend to the use of those cheap and
wholesome substitutes recommended by Mr. Malthus, by which means
they would have saved their own pockets, and not have ‘forced so
many persons on the parish.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If we were to double the fortunes of all those who possess above
a hundred a year, the effect on the price of grain would be slow and
inconsiderable; but if we were to double the price of labour throughout
the kingdom, the effect, in raising the price of grain, would be
rapid and great.’</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not see the harm of this rise. It would be in consequence of,
and would denote the number of bellies that were filled that had not
been filled before. Mr. Malthus in this passage seems to prefer a
little evil to a great good.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The parish rates and the prodigious sum expended in voluntary
charity, must have had a most powerful effect in raising the price of
the necessaries of life, if any reliance can be placed on the clearest
general principles, confirmed as much as possible by appearances. A
man with a family, has received, <em>to my knowledge</em>, fourteen shillings a
week from the parish.’ [Shocking to be sure.] ‘His common
earnings were ten shillings a week, and his weekly <em>revenue</em>, therefore,
twenty-four. Before the scarcity, he had been in the habit of purchasing
a bushel of flour a week with eight shillings perhaps, and
consequently had two shillings out of his ten, to spare for other
necessaries. During the scarcity, he was enabled to purchase the
same quantity at nearly three times the price. He paid twenty-two
shillings for his bushel of flour, and had, as before, two shillings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>remaining for other wants.’ [Good: but does Mr. Malthus deny
that the scarcity would of itself have raised the price of wheat?
And in that case if the labourer had had no addition to his ‘weekly
revenue,’ instead of having the large sum of two shillings at the end
of the week to lay out in other necessaries, he would have had
nothing. Perhaps Mr. Malthus is ready to prove, that half a bushel
of corn will go farther with a poor family in a time of scarcity than a
whole one, because they would husband it more carefully.] ‘Such
instances could not possibly have been universal, without raising the
price of wheat much higher than it really was during any part of
the dearth. But similar instances were by no means infrequent,
and <em>the system itself, of measuring the relief given by the price of grain,
was general</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot conceive of any better rule. But the gentleman is
alarmed at the <em>voluntary</em> contributions extorted from the rich. After
all, I do not see how the rich would suffer by their great charity, if,
as our author says, the poor got nothing by it. I would ask, were
the rich ever in danger of starving in the late scarcity, and were not
the poor in danger of it, and would they not have starved, but for the
assistance given to them? Is it better that the poor should starve
than that the rich should be at the expence of relieving them? Or
if the pressure in scarce times falls on the middle classes, have they
to complain, that they, in whom ‘life and death may always be said
to contend for victory,’ are still just kept alive, or that the sleek and
pampered continue to fatten on the distresses of others? The false
feeling which runs through all Mr. Malthus’s reasonings on this subject
is, that the upper classes cannot be expected to retrench any of
their superfluities, to lie at the mercy of the seasons, or to contribute
any thing to the general necessity, but that the whole burthen of a
scarcity ought to fall on those whom Mr. Malthus calls ‘the least
fortunate members of the community,’ on those who are most used to
distress, and in whom the transition is easy and natural from poverty
to famine! ‘They lay heavy burthens on the poor and needy, which
they will not touch with one of their fingers.’ Would it not be
worth our author’s while to comment on this text, and shew how
little it has been understood?—I remember to have heard of but one
instance of a real, effectual, and judicious determination in the rich to
retrench idle and superfluous waste and expence, some years ago at a
time when the poor were <em>in want of bread</em>. It originated in a great
and noble family, where seventy or eighty servants were kept, and
where twenty or thirty guests of the first distinction ‘fared sumptuously
every day.’ These humane and enlightened persons, struck
with the difference between their own good fortune, and the necessities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of others, came to a resolution that the pieces of bread which
they left at dinner should neither be thrown nor given away, but that
the bread-baskets should be divided into little compartments with each
person’s name affixed to them, where he could conveniently put the
piece of bread which he left, and have it <em>saved</em> till the next day.
This humane example was much talked of in the neighbourhood, and
soon after followed by several of the gentry, who got their bread-baskets
divided into little compartments with the different names
affixed, and eat the pieces of bread which they left one day, the day
after—so that the poor were thus placed completely out of the reach
of want!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus next talks about the embarrassments of commerce,
returning cheapness, &amp;c. Now I do not see, according to his doctrine,
what cheapness has to do with the question. He says, every
thing depends on the quantity of provisions in the country, and that
this being given, all the rest follows as a matter of course. What
then does it signify whether you call a piece of paper one pound or
two if you can get a proportionable quantity of food for your money?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If instead of giving the temporary assistance of parish allowances,
which might be withdrawn on the first fall of price, we had raised
universally the wages of labour, it is evident, that the obstacles to a
diminution of the circulation, and to returning cheapness, would have
been still further increased; and the high price of labour would
have become permanent, without any advantage whatever to the
labourer,’—or disadvantage to the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There is no one that more ardently desires to see a real advance
in the price of labour than myself; but the attempt to effect this
object by forcibly raising the nominal price, which was practised to
a certain degree, and recommended almost universally during the
late scarcities, every thinking man must reprobate as puerile and
ineffectual.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The price of labour, when left to find its natural level, is a most
important political barometer, expressing the relation between the
supply of provisions, and the demand for them; between the quantity
to be consumed, and the number of consumers; and taken on the
average, independently of accidental circumstances, it further expresses,
clearly, the wants of the society respecting population; that
is, whatever may be the number of children to a marriage necessary
to maintain exactly the present population, the price of labour will be
just sufficient to support this number, or be above it, or below it,
according to the state of the real funds for the maintainance of labour,
whether stationary, progressive, or retrograde. Instead, however, of
considering it in this light, we consider it as something which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>may raise or depress at pleasure, something which depends principally
upon his majesty’s justices of the peace. When an advance in the
price of provisions already expresses that the demand is too great for
the supply, in order to put the labourer in the same condition as
before, we raise the price of labour, that is, we increase the demand,
and are then much surprised that the price of provisions continues
rising. In this, we act much in the same manner, as if, when the
quicksilver in the common weather-glass stood at <em>stormy</em>, we were to
raise it by some forcible pressure to <em>settled fair</em>, and then be greatly
astonished that it continued raining.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is certainly a most excellent illustration. As to the argument
itself, it is all false and hollow. With respect to the rise in the
price of provisions consequent on the rise of wages, I am not I
confess at all concerned about it, so that the labourer is still enabled
to purchase the same <em>necessary</em> quantity as before. All that is wanted
is that the one should keep pace with the other. What the natural
level of the price of labour is, otherwise than as it is regulated by the
positive institutions of society, or as I have before stated, by the power
of one set of men, and the wants of another is—like many other
things in this book of Mr. Malthus’s—what I do not understand. If
we are to believe him, the whole is a trick. There is a pretence of
sacrificing something for the relief of the poor in hard times, and then
the next thing is to render that relief ineffectual, by out-bidding them,
by lowering the value of money, by creating artificial wealth, and
other methods. If then the rich are so entirely masters of the
price of labour that they can render it real or nominal as they please,
and take good care never to lose by it in the end, I should like to
know how this most important political barometer has any relation to
real plenty or want: how it expresses any thing more than the will
of the rich and great; or the miserable pittance they are willing to
allow out of the support of their own extravagant and ostentatious
establishments to the maintainance of the mass of the people. It does
indeed express the relation between the supply of provisions, and the
demand for them, &amp;c. supposing that a certain number of people are
to consume four or five times as much (either in quantity or quality)
as the others: and that this proportion is unalterable and one of the
laws of nature. It further expresses the wants of the society respecting
population, while this division continues, or that degree of
poverty beyond which it is impossible for people to subsist at all.
The object in a scarcity is not however to stop the ordinary process
of population, but to alleviate the distresses of those already in
existence, by a more equal distribution of the real funds for the
maintainance of labour. By these funds Mr. Malthus means any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>arbitrary division of the produce of the ground, which the rich find
it convenient to make, and which the poor are forced to take up with
as better than nothing. But the real funds for the maintenance of
labour are the produce of labour. According to Mr. Malthus, they
are not the produce itself, but what happens to be left of it, as the
husks only and not the corn are given to the swine.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The number of servants out of place, and of manufacturers wanting
employment during the late scarcities, were melancholy proofs of
the truth of these reasonings. If a general rise in the wages of
labour had taken place proportioned to the price of provisions, none
but farmers and a few gentlemen could have afforded to employ the
same number of workmen as before. Additional crowds of servants
and manufacturers would have been turned off; and those who were
thus thrown out of employment, would, of course, have no other
refuge than the parish. In the natural order of things, a scarcity
must tend to lower, instead of to raise, the price of labour.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This natural order has been already explained to mean a very
artificial order. Our ingenious author is a great admirer of moral
analogies. He sticks to the old proverb, those that have little shall
have less. ‘The most laborious and deserving part of the community’
are to bear the brunt of all distress, <em>ordinary and extraordinary</em>.
He will not suffer the positive regulations of society,
which carry inequality of conditions as far almost as it can go in
common cases, to relax a little in their favour in extreme cases, so as
not to push them quite out of existence. I know no reason why in
the natural order of things a scarcity should tend to lower, instead
of raising the price of labour; but upon that common principle that
the weakest are to go to the wall. The rich forsooth are a privileged
class, out of the reach of fortune, ‘whose solid virtue the shot of
accident or dart of change can neither graze nor pierce.’ In the
rest of this passage, Mr. Malthus quarrels with his own favourite
system, with those capricious and arbitrary institutions, in consequence
of which those who ministered only to the vanity and artificial wants
of the rich will in times of difficulty be turned adrift and reduced to
want, or else saddled as an additional weight on the common
labourer, who had enough to do to support them and their employers
under the most favourable circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>General answer.</span>—I wish Mr. Malthus to state explicitly
whether he means that the rise in the price of labour should be
nominal or real. He has shifted his ground four or five times on the
subject in the course of the chapter, now supposing it to be a mere
non-entity, and now fraught with the most terrible consequences,
famine, and God knows what. But it seems to me, that if nominal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>it must be nugatory, and therefore innocent; and that if real, it must
be proportionably beneficial. For if real, it must throw a greater
quantity of the necessaries or comforts of life into the hands of those
who most want them, and take them from those who are oppressed
with their superfluities. For suppose the quantity of food and the
quantity of money to be fixed, given quantities (unless we suppose
both, there is no reasoning about the matter) and that an additional
price is given for labour: let us suppose farther that this raises the
price of provisions. It is evident in this case, that the rich having
less money to give, and being obliged to give more for their former
luxuries, will be obliged to retrench somewhere. This must be
either in provisions, or other things. First, they may retrench in
the article of provisions. This will evidently leave a greater plenty
for others, who stand very much in need of them; and their
additional wages will be laid out in supplying themselves with what
they could not otherwise have obtained. Secondly, they may
retrench in articles of furniture, dress, houses, &amp;c. and there will
consequently be less demand for these things. Well then, in the first
place, with regard to provisions, the poor will be no worse off in
this respect than if there had been no advance in the price, for it is
not to be supposed that if the rich are so attached to the luxuries of
the belly as notwithstanding the increased price to buy the same
quantity as ever, that they would have bought less, if the price had
continued lower. They would have engrossed the markets at all
events. On the other hand, they must retrench their expences in
other things, in superfluities of different kinds, which will thus fall
into the hands of the poor, who having been excluded from the meat-market
can only lay out their additional wages in providing themselves
with household conveniences, good clothes, tables, chairs, &amp;c.
What should they do with their money? It is supposed that they
cannot get a morsel of meat with it: and it is not be expected that
they should throw it away. Sooner than do this, they might spend
it in buying smart buckles for their shoes, or garters and ribbons for
their sweethearts. The labour of the mechanic, inasmuch as it
is not wanted by the great, will go to enrich the lower classes. The
less they are employed by the rich, in consequence of ‘a more equal
distribution of the money of the society,’ the better able they will be
to employ one another. The farmer’s servant will employ the
mechanic with the same money with which the farmer or his landlord
would have employed him: if he has the same wages as before,
he will have as much to do, or if his wages are doubled, and he has
only half as much to do, this will be a proportionable relief to
him on the score of labour, and would be no prejudice to his earnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>as he would get the same wages for doing half as much work. But
there is no occasion to suppose any such slackness in the demand for
labour. The proportion between the money, the productive and
mechanical labour in the community, would remain the same: and
the rise in the wages of the labouring manufacturer and mechanic to
be real and effectual ought to be paid out of the profits of the master
and proprietor. In this case, the demand would be the same: and
it would evidently be his interest to employ the same number of
men that he did before, as though he would get less by each of them,
he must get more, the more hands he employs, as long as the demand
continues.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> If however our rich men and manufacturers should
grow sulky upon the occasion, and take it into their heads to hoard
their money in order to spite the poor, thus driving them altogether
out of employ, I conceive the best use that can be made of this
hoarded wealth would be to transfer it to the poor’s fund, for the
relief of those who are willing to work, but not to starve. On the
whole, and in every view of the subject it appears to me that any
addition to the price of labour must as far as it goes, be an advantage
to the labourer, and that the more general and permanent it is, the
greater will be the benefit to the labouring class of the community.
The rise of wages would certainly take from the pomp and luxury of
the rich, and it would as certainly and in the same proportion add to
the comforts of the poor. I am not here recommending such a change.
I only contend that it would follow the distribution of wealth; and
that it is absurd to say that the poorer a man is, the richer he will be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus’s acuteness amounts to a species of second-sight,
whenever there is a question of famine. Thus he demonstrates that
this must be the necessary consequence of fixing a maximum in a
time of scarcity. Now I do not see this necessary consequence,
because if it were fixed at a certain height above the common price
in proportion to the deficiency, this would check the too rapid
consumption. Or even without supposing this, as it would be
necessary to have some kind of law or order of the police to enforce
the observance of a maximum, and make the farmers and dealers
bring their corn to market, the quantities in which it was brought
forward might be regulated in the same way as the price. Besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>I do not believe that people would starve themselves with their eyes
open, whether the police interfered or not. As to the epithets of
illiberal, unjust, and narrow policy which some people may apply to
such a measure, I would ask them whether fixing the assize of bread
in London is not just the same thing. But corn-factors, forestallers and
regraters are a set of people whose liberal notions place them above
the law, who ought not to be looked upon in the same light with
every little scurvy knavish bread and biscuit baker, nor cramped in
their generous exertions to economize the public resources, and save
the poor from famine at the latter end of the year—by starving them
in the beginning. With respect to the parallel which Mr. Malthus
attempts to establish between fixing a maximum, and raising the price
of labour, I am so unfortunate as not to perceive it. He sometimes
argues against raising the price of labour because it would give the
poor no greater command over the provisions than before; he here
talks as if it would enable them to devour every thing before them.
I think neither of these suppositions is true. The high price of corn
in proportion to other things will always make people unwilling to
lay out more in that way than they can help, and will consequently
diminish the consumption. As to famine, people will look many
ways, before they submit to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Independently of any considerations respecting a year of deficient
crops, it is evident, that an increase of population, without a proportional
increase of food, must lower the value of each man’s
<em>earnings</em>. The food must necessarily be distributed in smaller
quantities, and consequently, a day’s labour will purchase a smaller
quantity of provisions.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Why of earnings more than property? Mr. Malthus would
have this considered as an elementary or philosophical work. Yet
he looks only at the flattering side of his subject. A day’s labour
will purchase a less quantity of provisions, but a day’s idleness will
purchase the same. In this case idleness and industry are plaintiff
and defendant; and the verdict is in favour of idleness, and industry
is not only cast, but pays the costs.—It is all very well.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The quantity of provisions consumed in workhouses, upon a part
of the society, that cannot in general be considered as the most
valuable part,’ [or in other houses on footmen, &amp;c. who are not the
most respectable kind of paupers] ‘diminishes the shares that would
otherwise belong to more industrious and more worthy members,
and thus in the same measure, forces more to become dependent.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Fortunately for England, a spirit of independence still remains
among the peasantry. The poor laws are strongly calculated to
eradicate this spirit.’ [Is it the man who reduces me to beggary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>or he who affords me relief, that lowers my condition and breaks my
spirit?] ‘They have succeeded in part; but had they succeeded
as completely as might have been expected, their pernicious tendency
would not have been so long concealed.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It would have been discovered sooner, if Mr. Malthus had read
Mr. Wallace’s book sooner.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The parish laws of England <em>appear</em> to have contributed to raise the
price of provisions and to lower the real price of labour.’ [Our
author’s demonstrations are delusive appearances. What must his
<em>appearances</em> be? Shall we take them for demonstrations?] ‘They
have therefore contributed to impoverish that class of people whose
only possession is their labour. It is also difficult to suppose, that
they have not powerfully contributed to generate that carelessness
and want of frugality observable among the poor, so contrary to the
disposition generally to be remarked among petty tradesmen and small
farmers. The labouring poor, to use a vulgar expression, seem always
to live from hand to mouth. Their present wants employ their whole
attention; and they seldom think of the future. Even when they
have an opportunity of saving, they seldom exercise it; but all that
they earn beyond their present necessities, goes, generally speaking,
to the alehouse. The poor laws may, therefore, be said to diminish
both the power, and the will, to save, among the common people, and
thus to weaken one of the strongest incentives to sobriety and industry,
and consequently to happiness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This passage is remarkable. It may be asked in the first place,
whether the parish laws are not equally open to petty tradesmen and
small farmers, as to the poor. If so, they cannot account for the
difference observable between them. I shall therefore, as far as this
very striking contrast goes, put the poor laws out of the question;
and say that the difference in their behaviour can arise from nothing
but the difference in their situations, from the greater hardships imposed
on the labouring part of the community, from their different
prospects in life, and the little estimation in which they are held.
Mr. Malthus accounts for the carelessness and laziness of the poor
from their casting a sheep’s-eye at the work-house. No: they are to
be accounted for from that poverty and depression which makes the
work-house a temptation to them. We cannot say of those who are
seduced by the prospect of a work-house—‘Alas from what height
fallen!’ Mr. Malthus proposes to remove this dazzling object out
of their way; to make them indulge in larger views of things by
setting before them the prospect of their wives and children starving,
in case of any accident to themselves, and to stimulate their industry
by lowering their wages. The poor live from hand to mouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>because, in general, they have no hopes of living in any other way.
They seldom think of the future, because they are afraid to think of
it. Their present wants employ their whole attention. This is
their misfortune. Others have better luck. They have no time to
think of wind-falls. Mr. Malthus may take his glass of wine after
dinner, and his afternoon’s nap, when, having got the Essay on
Population out of his head, queen Mab ‘comes to him with a tythe-pig’s
tail, tickling the parson as he lies asleep:—then dreams he of
another benefice.’ The poor cannot indulge in such pleasing speculations.
If what they earn beyond their immediate necessities goes to
the alehouse, it is because the severe labour they undergo requires
some relaxation, because they are willing to forget the <em>work-house</em>,
their old age, and the prospect of their wives and children starving,
and to drown care in a mug of ale, in noise, and mirth, and laughter,
and old ditties, and coarse jokes, and hot disputes; and in that sense
of short-lived comfort, independence and good-fellowship, which is
necessary to relieve the hurt mind and jaded body. But all these,
when our author’s system is once established, ‘shall no more
impart,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>No human patience can submit to everlasting toil and self-denial.
The prospect of mere physical comfort is not a match for continued
physical suffering: and the lower classes of the people have no other
motives to animate them to bear up against the ills of life, in habits of
moral reflection, in the pursuits and example of the rich, or in the
real respect and credit attached to their own good behaviour. You
reduce them almost to the condition of brutes, and then grudge them
their coarse enjoyments: you make machines of them, and then
expect from them firmness, resolution, the love of independence, the
fruits of an erect and manly spirit. Mr. Malthus, like the Sphinx,
destroys his victims by the help of riddles; and makes a snare of
impossibilities. As to the workmen and mechanics in manufacturing
towns (to say nothing of the closeness and unwholesomeness of their
occupations, which would go a good way in accounting for ‘their
drunkenness and dissipation’) the noise and turbulence in which they
live, and their being crowded together as they are must unfit them
for enjoying the quiet and stillness of domestic life: they are glad to
escape from the contempt which their ‘squalid appearance’ excites in
the well-dressed mob who walk the streets, and hide their greasy
clothes and smutched faces in the nearest pot-house; and to say the
truth, with respect to those of them who are married, the hard
features, the disjointed shapes, the coarse limbs, the carking countenances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and ill-humour of their wives, occasioned by the fretful wants
of a set of squalling children, cannot be supposed to prove so
attractive to them, as ‘the symmetry of person, the vivacity, the
voluptuous softness of temper, the affectionate kindness of feeling,
the imagination, and the wit’ which in Mr. Malthus’s opinion constitute
the charm of the sex. After all, are the higher classes a bit
better than their inferiors? Are drinking and dissipation confined to
the poor? As Mr. Malthus ingenuously observes, ‘Our Doctors
Commons and the lives that many married men [of the better sort]
are known to lead sufficiently prove the reverse of this.’ I believe it
will hardly be proposed to make moral merit a rule for the division of
the good things of fortune. The only difference in the vices of the
rich and the poor is, that the rich can <em>afford</em> theirs better. Nevertheless
they set up for censors and reformers of the morals of the
poor. I remember to have seen a red-faced swag-bellied bishop
(such another as Father Paul in the Duenna) who could drink his
two bottles of wine without being affected, belch out a severe reprimand
against a poor labouring man, who was staggering home after
drinking a quart of small beer. As to our author’s plan of <em>starving</em>
the poor out of their vices, I must say (all circumstances considered)
that I think it, in the first place, an impudent proposal, because their
executioners are no better than themselves; in the second place, a
silly proposal, because, if not literally followed up, it must evidently
defeat itself; in the third place, a malignant proposal, because if it
were strictly put in practice, it could only produce despair and sullen
insensibility among the poor, and destroy all traces of justice or
humanity among the rich; in the fourth place, a lying proposal,
because it is contrary to Mr. Malthus’s own reasonings, who in many
places has shewn that the only way to improve the condition of the
poor is not by urging them to extremity, but by raising them above
want, by inspiring them with a respect for themselves, and a taste for
the comforts and decencies of life by sharing in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That the poor (says Mr. Malthus) employed in manufactures
consider parish assistance as a <em>reason</em> why they may spend all the
wages which they earn, and enjoy themselves while they can, <em>appears
to be evident</em>, from the number of families that upon the failure of any
great manufactory, immediately fall upon the parish.’ This is an
assumption of the question. Our author here confounds the fact and
the reason together. It appears evident that the manufacturer often
spends his earnings as he gets them, but not that he does so in the
hope that his family may go to the parish after his death. ‘A man
who might not be deterred from going to the alehouse from the consideration
that on his death or sickness he should leave his wife and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>family upon the parish, might yet hesitate in thus dissipating his
earnings if he were assured that in either of these cases <em>his family must
starve</em>, or be left to the support of casual bounty.’ Now it has
appeared that his conduct is regulated by motives and circumstances
which have nothing to do with what happens to his wife and children
after his death. It may therefore be questioned whether the catastrophe
proposed by Mr. Malthus would have the desired effect. But
certainly it could not have this effect as long as there was a dependence
on casual bounty: and to stop up this resource it would be
absolutely necessary to call in the aid of the magistrate to prevent the
indiscreet and unavailing interference of private charity, and execute
the sentence of the law of nature and the law of God on his wife and
hapless progeny, justly doomed to starve for the neglect of their
parent. What effect this would have on the ‘moral sensibility of the
nation’ I leave to Mr. Malthus to determine with his well-known
penetration and humanity. ‘The suffering a poor family to perish of
want is bad enough: but I cannot conceive of any thing much more
detestable or shocking to the feelings than any direct regulation of
this kind, by whatever name it is sanctioned.’ Mr. Malthus may
perhaps object that I have quoted him unfairly; and applied to the
<em>organizing the starving of a family</em> what he applied to the direct
regulation of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">infanticide</span></i>,—a very different thing! Unfortunately, I
have not sufficient delicacy of <em>verbal</em> feeling to be able to find out the
difference.—Now I recollect, however, what shocked Mr. Malthus
so much in speaking of infanticide was the supposition that the parents
were to be forced to destroy their own children, when they thought
they could not maintain them; according to our author’s mode of starving
a family, the society are only to stand by and prevent others from
affording them assistance. Here we see there is not that direct
violation of the parental affection which, says Mr. Malthus, is the
principal aggravation of the other case. He explains the grounds of
this distinction in another part of his work. ‘If,’ says he, ‘the
parents desert their child, <em>they</em> ought to be answerable for the crime.
The infant is, comparatively speaking, of no value to the society,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> as
others will immediately supply its place. Its principal value is on
account of its being the object of one of the most delightful passions
in human nature—parental affection. But if this value be disregarded
by those who are <em>alone</em> in a capacity to feel it, the <em>society</em> cannot be
called upon to put itself in their place and has no further business in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>its protection,’ than just to see that its parents do not ill-use, or kill
or eat it. Nothing can be plainer than the inference from these
premises. The society, which is bound to prevent or punish the
least barbarity in parents towards their children, because they are to
them an object of a very delightful passion, may exercise any barbarity
it pleases on them itself, because it is not in a capacity to feel this
affection towards them. It is not only not called upon to put itself
in their place, but is bound to prevent others from doing so, and thus
reversing the laws of nature, by which ‘the child is confided exclusively
to its parents.’ It is only, says our author, by extinguishing
every spark of humanity in the breasts of the community towards the
children of others, that the ties of parental affection can ever exist in
their full force, or be expected ‘to remain in the state in which nature
has left them.’ Mr. Malthus may therefore in his zeal for the
growth of parental affection, and the entire suppression of common
humanity as subversive of it, very consistently brand every attempt of
the society to make the parents accomplices in starving their children,
as the greatest injustice, though we may very heroically proceed to
starve them ourselves, repeating after this high-priest of nature, Their
blood be upon us and upon <em>our</em> children! This is the best account I
can give of the fundamental distinction which Mr. Malthus makes
between the impropriety and inhumanity of <em>destroying children</em> by law,
and the propriety and humanity of <em>starving</em> a family by law. But I
shall recur to the same subject presently, when I come to the detail
of his plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus devotes the first and second chapters of his fourth
book to an inquiry into our obligations to regulate the sexual passion
by considerations of prudence, &amp;c. into the general capacity of human
nature to act from rational motives, and the good effects which would
result from such a conduct. He begins his third chapter in the
following manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He who publishes a moral code, or system of duties, however
firmly he may be convinced of the strong obligation on each individual
strictly to conform to it, has never the folly to imagine that it will be
universally or even generally practised. But this is no valid objection
against the publication of the code. If it were, the same objection
would always have applied; we should be totally without general
rules; and to the vices of mankind arising from temptation, would be
added a much longer list, than we have at present, of vices from
ignorance.’ [This is well said, and ’tis a kind of good deed to say
well.] ‘Judging merely from the light of nature, if we feel convinced
of the misery arising from a redundant population, on the one hand,
and of the evils and unhappiness, particularly to the female sex,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>arising from promiscuous intercourse, on the other, I do not see how
it is possible for any person, who acknowledges the principle of
utility as the great foundation of morals, to escape the conclusion
that moral restraint, till we are in a condition to support a family, is
the strict line of duty; and when revelation is taken into the question,
this duty undoubtedly receives very powerful confirmation. At the
same time, I believe that few of my readers can be less sanguine in
their expectations of any great change in the general conduct of men
on this subject than I am; and the chief reason, why, in the last
chapter, I allowed myself to suppose the universal prevalence of
this virtue, was, that I might endeavour to remove any imputation
on the goodness of the Deity, by shewing that the evils arising from
the principle of population were exactly of the same nature as the
generality of other evils which excite fewer complaints, that they
were increased by human ignorance and indolence, and diminished by
human knowledge and virtue; and on the supposition, that each
individual strictly fulfilled his duty, would be almost totally removed;
and this, without any general diminution of those sources of pleasure,
arising from the regulated indulgence of the passions, which have been
justly considered as the principal ingredients of human happiness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus here appears in the double character of a politician
and divine. Sir Hugh Evans says, ‘I like not when a ’omans has a
great peard.’ I must say, I do not like to see a philosopher in a
cassock. He has you at an unfair advantage, and it is a hundred
to one but he will make use of it. When he is pressed hard, or
sees his arguments in danger of being cut off, he puts them into the
false belly of theology. It is like hunting an otter: you do not
know where to have him.—What our author says of moral systems
is certainly true: neither the preaching of St. Paul, nor probably his
own has been able to put an end to that pious, courtly race of men,
who strive equally to serve God and mammon. Mr. Malthus in the
last chapter took an opportunity of paying his court to the former:
the leaf is no sooner turned, than he begins to insinuate himself into
the good graces of the latter, by disclaiming the sincerity of his late
professions. In the passage just quoted, Mr. Malthus not only tells
you that he had endeavoured to give a more favourable account of
the expectations of mankind and their capacity for virtue and happiness
than he believes has any foundation in human nature; but he at the
same time lets you into his motive for so doing, viz. his wish to
remove any imputation on the divine goodness, which purpose, it
seems, would not have been so well answered by the real statement
of the fact. Having thus decently paid his compliments to his
profession, and justified the goodness of God from <em>the ideal capacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of man for virtue</em> he next proceeds to prove the wisdom of human
institutions by his <em>real incapacity</em> for it. He was yesterday engaged
to whitewash Providence: to day he is retained on the other side of
the question, which he assures his clients shall not suffer through
any anxiety of his about consistency. This seems to be playing at
fast and loose both with religion and morality. Mr. Malthus has
indeed set apart the preceding chapter to shew that ‘the evils arising
from the principle of population are exactly of the same nature as the
generality of other evils which excite fewer complaints, that they
were increased by human ignorance and indolence, and diminished by
human knowledge and virtue.’ But I do not know what right he
had to do this, seeing that it is the express object of his work to
shew that the evils of population are unlike all other evils, neither
generated by human folly, nor to be removed or palliated by human
wisdom, but by vice and misery alone: that they are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</span></i>, and
not to be reasoned upon, like any thing else. Neither do I understand
how the evils of population can be said to excite more complaints than
other evils, when Mr. Malthus tells us that till his time nobody had
thought of tracing them to their true source, but erroneously ascribed
them to human institutions, vice, folly, &amp;c. Mr. Malthus himself
was the first who proved them to be irremediable and inherent in the
constitution of nature, and thus brought an imputation upon Providence.
To remove this imputation he supposes them to admit of a remedy:
then again lest any one should take him at his word and be for
applying this remedy, he says they admit of no such remedy; and
that it was all an idle supposition of his own without any foundation,
a harmless picture drawn to illustrate the <em>imaginary</em> goodness of
Providence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If it will answer any purpose of illustration, I see no harm in
drawing the picture of a society in which each individual is supposed
strictly to fulfil his duties: nor does a writer appear to be justly
liable to the imputation of being visionary, unless he makes such
universal or general obedience necessary to the practical utility of
his system, and to that degree of moderate and partial improvement,
which is all that can rationally be expected from the most complete
knowledge of our duties.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But in this respect, there is an essential difference between that
improved state of society which I have supposed in the last chapter,
and most of the other speculations on this subject. The improvement
there supposed, if we ever should make approaches towards it, is to
be effected in the way in which we have been in the habit of seeing
all the greatest improvements effected, by a direct application to the
interest and happiness of each individual. It is not required of us to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>act from motives, to which we are unaccustomed; to pursue a general
good, which we may not distinctly comprehend, or the effect of which
may be weakened by distance or diffusion.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Is there not such a virtue as patriotism? To what class of
motives would our author refer this feeling? The way in which
Mr. Malthus wishes to effect his improvement in the virtue and
happiness of mankind, is one in which no such improvement has
hitherto been effected. But I see Mr. Malthus’s object. He is
only anxious, lest any one should attempt to rear the fabric of human
excellence on any other basis than that of vice and misery. So that
we begin with this solid and necessary foundation, he does not care
to what height the building is carried. So that we set out on our
journey of reform through the gate at which Mr. Malthus is sitting
at the receipt of custom, (whether it faces the road or not) it
gives him little concern what direction we take, or how far we go
afterwards, or whether we ever reach our promised destination.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The duty of each individual is express and intelligible to the
humblest capacity. It is merely that he is not to bring beings into
the world for whom he cannot find the means of support. When
once this subject is cleared from the obscurity thrown over it by
parochial laws and <em>private benevolence</em>, every man must feel the
strongest conviction of such an obligation. If he cannot support
his children, they must <em>starve</em>; and if he marry in the face of a fair
probability that he shall not be able to support his children, he is
guilty of all the evils which he thus brings upon himself, his wife,
and his offspring. It is clearly his interest, and will tend greatly to
promote his happiness to defer marrying, till, by industry and
economy, he is in a capacity to support the children, that he may
reasonably expect from his marriage and as he cannot in the mean
time, gratify his passions, without violating <em>an express command of
God</em>, and running a great risk of injuring himself, or some of his
fellow creatures, considerations of his own interest and happiness will
dictate to him the strongest obligation to moral restraint.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘However powerful may be the impulses of passion <em>they are
generally in some degree modified by reason</em>. And it does not seem
entirely visionary to suppose, that if the true and permanent cause
of poverty were clearly explained,’ [This I take to be that the rich
have more than the poor] ‘and forcibly brought home to each man’s
bosom, it would have some, and perhaps not an inconsiderable,
influence on his conduct; at least, the experiment has never yet been
fairly tried.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It is astonishing, what a propensity Mr. Malthus has to try
experiments, if there is any mischief to be done by them. He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>a perfect horror of experiments that are to be tried on the higher
qualities of our nature, from which any great, unmixed, and general
good is to be expected. But in proportion as the end is low, and
the means base, he acquires confidence, his tremours forsake him, and
he approaches boldly to the task with nerves of iron. His humanity
is of a singular cast. What is grand and elevated, seems to be his
aversion. Pure benefits are of too cloying a quality to please his
taste. He is willing to improve the morals of the people by
extirpating the common feelings of mankind, and will submit to the
introduction of a greater degree of plenty and comfort, provided it is
prefaced by famine.</p>

<p class='c011'>His ardour is kindled not so much in proportion to the difficulty,
as to the disgusting nature of the task. He is a kind of sentimental
nightman, an amateur chimney-sweeper, a patriotic Jack-ketch. The
spirit of adventure is roused in him only by the prospect of dirty
roads, and narrow, crooked paths. He never flinches where there is
any evil to be done, that good may come of it! His present plan
is an admirable one of the kind—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne tulit punctum</span></i>—it comprises
both extremes of vice and misery. The poor are to make a formal
surrender of their right to private charity or parish assistance, that
the rich may be able to lay out all their money on their vices.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Till these erroneous ideas have been corrected, and the language
of <em>nature</em> and reason has been generally heard on the subject of
population, instead of the language of error and prejudice, it cannot
be said that any fair experiment has been made with the understandings
of the common people; and we cannot justly accuse them of improvidence
and want of industry, till they act as they do now, after
it has been brought home to their comprehensions, that they are themselves
the cause of their own poverty; that the means of redress are in
their own hands, and <em>in the hands of no other persons whatever; that the
society in which they live, and the government which presides over it, are
totally without power in this respect</em>; and however ardently they may
desire to relieve them, and whatever attempts they may make to do so,
they are really and truly unable to execute what they benevolently wish,
but unjustly promise; that when the wages of labour will not maintain
a family, it is an incontrovertible sign that <em>their king and country do not
want more subjects</em>, or at least that <em>they cannot support them</em>; that if
they marry in this case, so far from fulfilling a duty to society, they
are throwing a useless burden on it, at the same time that they are
plunging themselves into distress; and that they are acting directly
contrary to the will of God, and bringing down upon themselves
various diseases, which might all, or in a great part, have been
avoided, if they had attended to the repeated admonitions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>he gives, by the general laws of nature, to every being capable of
reason.’<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The erroneous ideas of which Mr. Malthus here complains as
prevailing in the minds of the common people, to the prejudice of the
language of reason and nature, are, as he states just before, that their
poverty and distress are <em>in part</em> owing to their not getting more for
their labour, to the slowness with which the parish assist them, to the
avarice of the rich, and to the institutions of society, or to fortune
which has assigned them a place so beset with difficulties and dependence!
No, poverty is owing to none of these causes, but it is owing
entirely to <em>itself</em>. Mr. Burke has said, that people will not be argued
into slavery. Our author attempts more than this. He tries to
persuade them out of their senses, and to argue them into slavery and
famine besides. There is a distinction which it is sometimes dangerous
to insist on in common life; but which it is necessary to attend
to in matters of reasoning, and that is the distinction between truth
and falsehood. For instance, Mr. Malthus asserts, that the means of
remedying their complaints are in the hands of the poor, and in the
hands of no other persons whatever. Now this is not true. It is not
true that the society in which they live and the government which presides
over it are <em>totally</em> without power in this respect. It is not true
that however ardently they may wish to relieve them, they are utterly
unable to execute their benevolent intentions. It is not an incontrovertible
sign that their king and country do not want more subjects,
and that they cannot support them, when the common wages of labour
will not maintain a family. As Mr. Malthus’s positions exist no
where but in the Essay of Population, they will hardly support those
weighty practical conclusions which he wishes to build upon them.
Some persons may perhaps be at a loss to understand what Mr.
Malthus can mean by his assertions. The following may be some
clue to what in itself has very much the appearance of irony.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Among the other prejudices which have prevailed on the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of population, it has been generally thought, that while there is either
waste among the rich, or land remaining uncultivated in any country,
the complaint for want of food cannot be justly founded, or, at least,
that the pressure of distress upon the poor is to be attributed to the ill-conduct
of the higher classes of society, and the bad management of
the land. The real effect, however, of these two circumstances, is
merely to narrow the limit of the actual population; but they have little
or no influence on what may be called the average pressure of distress on
the poorer members of society. If our ancestors had been so frugal
and industrious, and had transmitted such habits to their posterity,
that nothing superfluous was now consumed by the higher classes, no
horses were used for pleasure, and no land was left uncultivated, a
striking difference would appear in the state of the actual population;
but probably none whatever, in the state of the lower classes of people,
with respect to the price of labour, and the facility of supporting a
family. The waste among the rich and the horses kept for pleasure,
have indeed a little the effect of the consumption of grain in distilleries,
noticed before with regard to China. On the supposition that the
food consumed in this manner may be withdrawn on the occasion of a
scarcity, and be applied to the relief of the poor, they operate,
certainly, as far as they go, like granaries which are only opened at
the time that they are most wanted, and must therefore tend rather to
benefit than injure the lower classes of society.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘With regard to uncultivated land, it is evident that its effect upon
the poor is neither to injure, nor to benefit them. The sudden cultivation
of it, will indeed tend to improve their condition for a time,
and the neglect of lands before cultivated, will certainly make their
situation worse for a certain period; but when no changes of this kind
are going forward, the effect of uncultivated land on the lower classes,
operates merely like the possession of a smaller territory.’</p>

<p class='c011'>After what has been said in various parts of these observations, I
might leave these passages to the contempt of the reader. But Mr.
Malthus shall not complain of my remissness. I will give him heaped
measure. I say then that the argument here employed leads to a
direct absurdity: for it would justify any degree of neglect, or waste,
or wanton abuse that can be imagined. If thirty-nine out of the forty
counties in England were laid waste to-morrow, this would be no evil,
according to Mr. Malthus, because it would not increase the average
pressure of distress in the remaining one. If half the corn that is
grown every year, besides what is already employed in supplying the
waste of the rich, were regularly sent off by waggon-loads, and thrown
into the sea, there would be still no harm done. A <em>striking</em> difference
would undoubtedly appear in the number of poor people, but probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>none whatever in the state of those who had not been starved. If double
the number of horses were kept for pleasure, and only half the number
of poor were kept alive, these latter would have no reason to complain,
because they would be as well, or better off than ever; and if a limited
number are tolerably well provided for, this is all that can ever be
expected, because by the laws of nature it is impossible to provide for
an unlimited number. To say nothing of those immense granaries
and boundless resources which are thus formed in the uncultivated
parts of the earth, or which might be created at any time of
extraordinary distress by employing in the service of man what had
hitherto been providently reserved for the beasts.</p>

<p class='c011'>While there is waste among the rich, or neglect of lands, or while
the breed of horses is encouraged so as to put a stop to the breed of
men, I deny that the distresses of the poor, or the restraints on population
are the necessary effects of the laws of nature, or of the unavoidable
disproportion between the increase of mankind and the capacity of the
earth to produce food for a greater number. But Mr. Malthus has
his usual resource. Though the distresses of the poor were actually
relieved as they might be, and though the unnecessary checks to
population were taken off, yet the time would come when these wants
could no longer be supplied, and when the restraints on population
would become necessary, from the inability of the earth to yield any
more, and from the whole produce being applied to the best advantage.
This is undoubtedly true: but I do not think it a reason that we are
not to put off the evil as long as we can, or that we are not to attempt
any improvement, because we cannot go on for ever improving. Death
is certain, and ‘will come when it will come.’ Is that a reason why
I should take poison? There is in all Mr. Malthus’s arguments on
this subject the same <em>twist</em> that there was in the Irish servant, who
was told to call his master early, and waked him two hours before the
time to tell him how much longer he had to sleep. Mr. Malthus
would have insisted on his getting up and dressing himself in the
middle of the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus allows, that ‘the object of those who really wish to
better the condition of the poor must be to raise the relative proportion
between the price of labour, and the price of provisions.’ Almost
in the next paragraph, however, he adds, that if we are really serious
in this object, ‘we must explain to them the true nature of their
situation, and shew them that <em>the withholding the supplies of labour is
the only possible way of raising its real price</em>.’ I cannot help thinking,
to use his own words, that our author’s ‘benevolence to the poor must
be either childish play, or hypocrisy: that it must be either to amuse
himself, or to pacify the minds of the common people with a mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>shew of attention to their wants.’ He proceeds to instruct the poor
in their true situation in a chapter which requires a few comments.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The pressure of distress on the lower classes of people, with the
habit of attributing this distress to their rulers, appears to me to be the
rock of defence, the castle, the guardian spirit, of despotism. It
affords to the tyrant the fatal and unanswerable plea of <em>necessity</em>.’
[That is Mr. Malthus’s plea.] ‘While any dissatisfied man of talents
has power to persuade the lower classes of people, that all their
poverty and distress arise solely from the iniquity of the government,
though perhaps the greatest part of what they suffer is totally unconnected
with this cause, it is evident that the seeds of fresh discontents,
and fresh revolutions, are continually sowing.’</p>

<p class='c011'>That is, the way to prevent revolutions, and at the same time to
produce lasting reforms is to persuade the people that all the evils
which they suffer, or which the government may chuse to inflict upon
them are their own fault. The way to put governments upon their
good behaviour is to give them a licence to do as much mischief as
they please, without being answerable for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of the tendency of mobs to produce tyranny, we may not be long
without an example in this country. <em>As a friend to freedom, and an
enemy to large standing armies</em>, it is with extreme reluctance that I am
compelled to acknowledge, that, had it not been for the organized
force in the country, the distresses of the people during the late
scarcities, encouraged by the extreme ignorance and folly of many
among the higher classes, might have driven them to commit the most
dreadful outrages, and ultimately to involve the country in all the
horrors of famine.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Does Mr. Malthus think that this hint will dispose the government
to keep up their large standing armies, or to mitigate the distresses of
the people? I wonder, if Blifil had happened to be an author,
whether he might not have written such a book as this.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Should such periods often recur, a recurrence which we have too
much reason to apprehend from the present state of the country, the
prospect which opens to our view is melancholy in the extreme. The
English constitution will be seen hastening with rapid strides to
the <em>Euthanasia</em> foretold by Hume; unless its progress be interrupted
by some popular commotion; and this alternative presents a picture
still more appalling to the imagination. If political discontents were
blended with the cries of hunger, and a revolution were to take place
by the instrumentality of a mob, clamouring for want of food, the
consequences would be unceasing change and unceasing carnage,
the bloody career of which, nothing but the establishment of some
complete despotism could arrest.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The gentleman seems greatly alarmed at his own predictions.
He points out to government the dangers arising from mobs; and
shews that these again arise from discontent, and repining against the
good order of society. The way proposed to cure them of this
discontent, and these false notions of society is to break asunder at
once the link of humanity which binds the poor to the rich, to
reduce them to extremity, to cut off all hope, all over-weening
expectation, all mutual kindness and good offices, by exploding the
very idea of the rights of the poor, or the duties of the rich, and
thus to tame them so effectually and systematically, that we shall be
in no danger from mobs, revolutions, or military despotism, but shall
conclude with a happy Euthanasia!</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To say that our conduct is not to be regulated by circumstances,
is to betray an ignorance of the most <em>solid</em> and incontrovertible principles
of morality.’ [An odd phrase. Solid seems to imply something
fixed. We should hardly talk of a <em>solid</em> bridge of boats, though
they might afford tolerably safe footing.] ‘Though the admission
of this principle may sometimes afford a cloke to changes of opinion
that do not result from the purest motives; yet the admission of
a contrary principle would be productive of infinitely worse consequences.
The phrase of existing circumstances has, I believe, not
unfrequently created a smile in the English House of Commons; but
the smile should have been reserved for the application of the phrase
and not have been excited by the phrase itself.’ [He teaches us to
smile by the book.] ‘A very frequent repetition of it, has indeed,
of itself, rather a suspicious air; and its application should always be
watched with the most jealous and anxious attention; but no man
ought to be judged <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</span></i> for saying, that existing circumstances
had obliged him to alter his opinions and conduct. The country
gentlemen were perhaps too easily convinced that existing circumstances
called upon them to give up some of the most valuable
privileges of Englishmen; but, as far as they were really convinced
of this obligation, they acted consistently with the <em>clearest rule</em> of
morality.’ [Begging the learned writer’s pardon, it is rather the
exception than the rule. Did Junius Brutus, when he killed his son,
act in conformity to the <em>clearest rule of morality</em>? Mr. Malthus has
not quite got rid of the leaven of his old philosophy.]</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The degree of power to be given to the civil government, and the
measure of our submission to it, must be determined by general
expediency.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is saying a good deal. The rule which Mr. Malthus then
lays down for ‘a rising of the people,’ seems to be that when they
are enlightened and well off, that is, when the government is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>good one, they may rebel against it: but when they are kept in a
state of ignorance and want, then they are to blame, if they are at all
refractory: they are to be considered as the causes of that very
oppression which they are endeavouring to resist, and as giving a
farther handle to that tyranny, which their superiors are thus forced to
exercise in self-defence, not from any innate love of power, or predilection
for violent measures.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All improvements in government must necessarily originate with
persons of some education, and these will of course be found among
the people of property. Whatever may be said of a few, it is
impossible that the great mass of the people of property should be
really interested in the abuses of government. They merely submit
to them, from the fear, that an endeavour to remove them, might be
productive of greater evils. Could we but take away this fear, reform
and improvement would proceed with as much facility, as the removal
of nuisances, or the paving and lighting the streets. Remove all
apprehension from the tyranny or folly of the people, and the tyranny
of government could not stand a moment. It would then appear in
its proper deformity, without palliation, without pretext, without
protector. Naturally feeble in itself, when it was once stripped
naked, and deprived of the support of public opinion, and of the great
<em>plea of necessity</em>, it would fall without a struggle.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is a new view of the subject. What then, mankind are
governed by the pure love of justice! The people of property and
education have no vices or follies of their own, which blind their
understandings, no prejudices about royalty, or aristocracy, or church
or state, no attachment to party, no dependence on great men, no
hopes of preferment, no connections, no privileges, no interest in the
abuses of government, no pride, none of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>, to hinder
them from pronouncing sentence on the laws, institutions, uses, and
abuses of society with the same calmness, disinterestedness, and
wisdom, as they would upon cleaning a sewer, or paving a street.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The most successful supporters of tyranny are without doubt
those general declaimers, who attribute the distresses of the poor,
and almost all the evils to which society is subject, to human institutions
and the iniquity of governments.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is like those highwaymen, who attribute their ill treatment of
their victims to the resistance they make.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Whatever therefore may be the intention of those indiscriminate
and wholesale accusations against governments, their real effect
undoubtedly is, to add a weight of talents and principles to the
prevailing power which it never would have received otherwise.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This is possible: but the effect of Mr. Malthus’s method would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>that they would not want the additional weight either of talents or
principle, but would laugh in your face.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The inference, therefore, which Mr. Paine and others have drawn
against governments from the unhappiness of the people, is palpably
unfair; and before we give a sanction to such accusations, it is a debt
we owe to truth and justice, to ascertain how much of this unhappiness
arises from the principle of population, and how much is fairly
to be attributed to government. When this distinction has been
properly made, and all the vague, indefinite, and false accusations
removed, government would remain, as it ought to be, clearly
responsible for the rest. A tenfold weight would be immediately
given to the cause of the people, and every man of principle would
join in asserting and enforcing, if necessary, their rights.’</p>

<p class='c011'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes.</span></i> Our author here wishes to delay
the question in order to give additional weight to the cause of the
people. This is something as if upon a stranger coming into a house
almost fainting with hunger and cold, we should advise him not to
go near the fire, nor take any thing to eat, for that there is a great
apothecary in the neighbourhood who sometimes calls in about that
time of the day, who will be able to tell him exactly how much of
his illness proceeds from cold, and how much from hunger, whether
he should eat, or warm himself first, and how the one would assist
the other. The man might naturally answer, I know that I am very
cold and hungry: I will therefore first sit down by the fire, and if,
in the mean time, you can let me have any thing to eat, I shall be
heartily glad of it. Otherwise the advice of the apothecary will
come too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I cannot help thinking, therefore, that a knowledge generally
circulated, that the principal cause of want and unhappiness is
unconnected with government, and totally beyond its power to
remove would, instead of giving any advantage to governments, give
a great additional weight to the popular side of the question, by
removing the dangers with which, from ignorance, it is at present
accompanied: and thus tend, in a very powerful manner, to promote
the cause of rational freedom.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The mode in which Mr. Malthus strengthens the popular side is
by disarming it of all power or pretence for resistance. Undoubtedly
that must be a strange sort of strength which is founded on impotence.
The people are only secure against the encroachments of power from
their inability to resist it. This is like clapping a man into a dungeon
to save him from the pursuit of his creditors. Mr. Malthus promotes
the cause of rational freedom, as the husband secured the virtue of
his wife in the sign of the Good Woman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Mr. Malthus’s plan for the abolition of the poor laws is as
follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I should propose a regulation to be made, declaring, that no
child born from any marriage, taking place after the expiration of
a year from the date of the law; and no illegitimate child born two
years from the same date, should ever be entitled to parish assistance.
And to give a more general knowledge of this law, and to enforce
it more strongly on the minds of the lower classes of people, the
clergyman of each parish should after the publication of banns, read
a short address, stating the strong obligation on every man to support
his own children; the impropriety, and even immorality, of marrying
without a fair prospect of being able to do this; the evils which had
resulted to the poor themselves, from the attempt which had been
made to assist by public institutions in a duty which ought to be
exclusively appropriated to parents; and the absolute necessity which
had at length appeared, of abandoning all such institutions, on account
of their producing effects totally opposite to those which were
intended.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This would operate as a fair, distinct, and precise notice, which
no man could well mistake; and without pressing hard on any
particular individuals, would at once throw off the rising generation
from that miserable and helpless dependence upon the government
and the rich, the moral as well as physical consequences of which
are almost incalculable.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘After the public notice which I have proposed had been given,
and the system of poor laws had ceased with regard to the rising
generation, if any man chose to marry, without a prospect of being
able to support a family, he should have the most perfect liberty so
to do. Though to marry, in this case, is in my opinion clearly an
immoral act, yet it is not one which society can justly take upon
itself to prevent or punish; because the punishment provided for it
by the laws of nature, falls directly, and most severely upon the
individual who commits the act, and through him, only more remotely
and feebly on the society. When nature will govern and punish for
us, it is a very miserable ambition to wish to snatch the rod from her
hands, and draw upon ourselves the odium of executioner. To the
punishment therefore of nature he should be left, the punishment of
severe want. He has erred in the face of a most clear and precise
warning, and can have no just reason to complain of any person but
himself, when he feels the consequences of his error. All parish
assistance should be most rigidly denied him: and if the hand of
private charity be stretched forth in his relief, the interests of
humanity imperiously require that it should be administered very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>sparingly. He should be taught to know that the laws of nature,
which are the laws of God, had doomed him and his family to
starve for disobeying their repeated admonitions;’ [nay his family
had no hand in disobeying these admonitions] ‘that he had no claim
of <em>right</em> on society for the smallest portion of food, beyond that
which his labour would fairly purchase; and that if he and his
family were saved from suffering the extremities of hunger, he would
owe it to the pity of some kind benefactor, to whom, therefore, he
ought to be bound by the strongest ties of gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If this system were pursued, we need be under no apprehensions
that the number of persons in extreme want would be beyond the
power and the will of the benevolent to supply. The sphere for the
exercise of private charity would, I am confident, be less than it is at
present; and the only difficulty would be, to restrain the hand of
benevolence from assisting those in distress in so indiscriminate a
manner as to encourage indolence and want of foresight in others.’</p>

<p class='c011'>I am not sorry that I am at length come to this passage. It will I
hope decide the reader’s opinion of the benevolence, wisdom, piety,
candour, and disinterested simplicity of Mr. Malthus’s mind. Any
comments that I might make upon it to strengthen this impression
must be faint and feeble. I give up the task of doing justice to the
moral beauties that pervade every line of it, in despair. There are
some instances of an heroical contempt for the narrow prejudices of
the world, of a perfect refinement from the vulgar feelings of human
nature, that must only suffer by a comparison with any thing else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus prefaces his plan by saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I have reflected much on the subject of the poor laws, and hope
therefore that I shall be excused in venturing to suggest a mode of
their gradual abolition, to which I confess that at present I can see
no material objection. Of this indeed I feel nearly convinced, that
should we ever become sufficiently sensible of the wide-spreading
tyranny, dependence, indolence, and unhappiness, which they create,
as seriously to make an effort to abolish them, we shall be compelled
by a sense of justice to adopt the principle, if not the plan, which I
shall mention. It seems impossible to get rid of so extensive a
system of support, consistently with humanity, without applying ourselves
directly to its vital principle, and endeavouring to counteract
that deeply-seated cause, which occasions the rapid growth of all such
establishments, and invariably renders them inadequate to their object.
As a previous step even to any considerable alteration in the present
system, which would contract, or stop the increase of the relief to be
given, it appears to me that we are bound in justice and honour
formally to disclaim the <em>right</em> of the poor to support.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Now I shall not myself be so uncandid as not to confess, that I
think the poor laws bad things; and that it would be well, if they
could be got rid of, consistently with humanity and justice. This I
do not think they could in the present state of things and other
circumstances remaining as they are. The reason why I object to
Mr. Malthus’s plan is that it does not go to the root of the evil, or
attack it in its principle, but its effects. He confounds the cause
with the effect. The wide spreading tyranny, dependence, indolence,
and unhappiness of which Mr. Malthus is so sensible, are not occasioned
by the increase of the poor-rates, but these are the natural
consequence of that increasing tyranny, dependence, indolence, and
unhappiness occasioned by other causes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus desires his readers to look at the enormous proportion
in which the poor-rates have increased within the last ten years. But
have they increased in any greater proportion than the other taxes,
which rendered them necessary, and which I think were employed
for much more mischievous purposes? I would ask, what have the
poor got by their encroachments for the last ten years? Do they
work less hard? Are they better fed? Do they marry oftener, and
with better prospects? Are they grown pampered and insolent?
Have they changed places with the rich? Have they been cunning
enough, by means of the poor-laws, to draw off all their wealth and
superfluities from the men of property? Have they got so much as
a quarter of an hour’s leisure, a farthing candle, or a cheese-paring
more than they had? Has not the price of provisions risen enormously?
Has not the price of labour almost stood still? Have not
the government and the rich had their way in every thing? Have
they not gratified their ambition, their pride, their obstinacy, their
ruinous extravagance? Have they not squandered the resources of
the country as they pleased? Have they not heaped up wealth on
themselves, and their dependents? Have they not multiplied sinecures,
places, and pensions? Have they not doubled the salaries of
those that existed before? Has there been any want of new creations
of peers, who would thus be impelled to beget heirs to their titles and
estates, and saddle the younger branches of their rising families, by
means of their new influence, on the country at large? Has there
been any want of contracts, of loans, of monopolies of corn, of good
understanding between the rich and the powerful to assist one another,
and to fleece the poor? Have the poor prospered? Have the rich
declined? What then have they to complain of? What ground is
there for the apprehension, that wealth is secretly changing hands,
and that the whole property of the country will shortly be absorbed
in the poor’s fund? Do not the poor create their own fund? Is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the necessity for such a fund first occasioned by the unequal weight
with which the rich press upon the poor, and has not the increase of
that fund in the last ten years been occasioned by the additional
exorbitant demands, which have been made upon the poor and
industrious, which without some assistance from the public they
could not possibly have answered? Whatever is the increase in the
nominal amount of the poor’s fund, will not the rich always be able
ultimately to throw the burthen of it on the poor themselves? But
Mr. Malthus is a man of general principles. He cares little about
these circumstantial details, and petty objections. He takes higher
ground. He deduces all his conclusions, by an infallible logic, from
the laws of God and nature. When our Essayist shall prove to me,
that by these paper bullets of the brain, by his ratios of the increase
of food and the increase of mankind, he has prevented one additional
tax, or taken off one oppressive duty, that he has made a single rich
man retrench one article at his table, that he has made him keep a
dog or a horse the less, or part with a single vice, arguing from
a mathematical admeasurement of the size of the earth, and the
number of inhabitants it can contain, he shall have my perfect leave
to disclaim the right of the poor to subsistence, and to tie them down
by severe penalties to their good behaviour on the same profound principles.
But why does Mr. Malthus practise his demonstrations on
the poor only? Why are they to have a perfect system of rights and
duties prescribed to them? I do not see why they alone should be
put to live on these <em>metaphysical</em> board-wages, why they should be
forced to submit to a course of <em>abstraction</em>; or why it should be meat
and drink to them, more than to others, to do the will of God.
Mr. Malthus’s gospel is preached only to the poor!—Even if I
approved of our author’s plan, I should object to the principle on
which it is founded. The parson of the parish, when a poor man
comes to be married—No, not so fast. The author does not say,
whether the lecture he proposes is to be read to the poor only, or to
all ranks of people. Would it not sound oddly, if when the squire,
who is himself worth a hundred thousand pounds, is going to be
married to the rector’s daughter, who is to have fifty, the curate
should read them a formal lecture on their obligation to maintain their
own children, and not turn them on the parish? Would it be
necessary to go through the form of the address, when an amorous
couple of eighty presented themselves at the altar? If the admonition
were left to the parson’s own discretion, what affronts would he
not subject himself to, from his neglect of old maids, and superannuated
widows, and from his applying himself familiarly to the
little shop-keeper, or thriving mechanic? Well then let us suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>that a very poor hard-working man comes to be married, and that the
clergyman can take the liberty with him: he is to warn him first
against fornication, and in the next place against matrimony. These
are the two greatest sins which a poor man can commit, who can
neither be supposed to keep his wife, nor his girl. Mr. Malthus,
however, does not think them equal: for he objects strongly to a
country fellow’s marrying a girl whom he has debauched, or, as the
phrase is, making an honest woman of her, as aggravating the crime,
because by this means the parish will probably have three or four
children to maintain instead of one. However, as it seems rather too
late to recommend fornication or any thing else to a man who is
actually come to be married (he must be a strange sawney who could
turn back at the church-door after bringing a pretty rosy girl to hear
a lecture on the principle of population) it is most natural to suppose
that he would marry the young woman in spite of this principle.
Here then he errs in the face of a precise warning, and should be left
to the punishment of <em>nature</em>, the punishment of severe want. When
he begins to feel the consequences of his error, all parish assistance is
to be rigidly denied him, and the interests of humanity imperiously
require that all other assistance should be withheld from him, or most
sparingly administered. In the mean time to reconcile him to this
treatment, and let him see that he has nobody to complain of but
himself, the parson of the parish comes to him with the certificate of
his marriage, and a copy of the warning he had given him at the time,
by which he is taught to know that the laws of nature, which are the
laws of God, had doomed him and his family to starve for disobeying
their repeated admonitions; that he had no claim of right to the
smallest portion of food beyond what his labour would actually purchase;
and that he ought to kiss the feet and lick the dust off the
shoes of him, who gave him a reprieve from the just sentence which
the laws of God and nature had passed upon him. To make this
clear to him, it would be necessary to put the Essay on Population
into his hands, to instruct him in the nature of a geometrical and
arithmetical series, in the necessary limits to population from the size
of the earth, and here would come in Mr. Malthus’s plan of education
for the poor, writing, arithmetic, the use of the globes, &amp;c. for
the purpose of proving to them the necessity of their being starved.
It cannot be supposed that the poor man (what with his poverty and
what with being priest-ridden) should be able to resist this body of
evidence, he would open his eyes to his error, and ‘would submit to
the sufferings that were absolutely irremediable with the fortitude of a
man, and the resignation of a Christian.’ He and his family might
then be sent round the parish in a starving condition, accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the constables and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quondam</span></i> overseers of the poor, to see that no
person, blind to ‘the interests of humanity,’ practised upon them the
abominable deception of attempting to relieve their remediless sufferings,
and by the parson of the parish to point out to the spectators the
inevitable consequences of sinning against the laws of God and man.
By celebrating a number of these <em>Auto da fes</em> yearly in every parish,
the greatest publicity would be given to the principle of population,
‘the strict line of duty would be pointed out to every man,’ enforced
by the most powerful sanctions, justice and humanity would flourish,
they would be understood to signify that the poor have no right to
live by their labour, and that the feelings of compassion and benevolence
are best shewn by denying them charity, the poor would no
longer be dependent on the rich, the rich could no longer wish to
reduce the poor into a more complete subjection to their will, all
causes of contention, of jealousy, and of irritation would have ceased
between them, the struggle would be over, each class would fulfil the
task assigned by heaven, the rich would oppress the poor without
remorse, the poor would submit to oppression with a pious gratitude
and resignation, the greatest harmony would prevail between the
government and the people, there would be no longer any seditions,
tumults, complaints, petitions, partisans of liberty, or tools of power,
no grumbling, no repining, no discontented men of talents proposing
reforms, and frivolous remedies, but we should all have the same
gaiety and lightness of heart, and the same happy spirit of resignation
that a man feels when he is seized with the plague, who thinks no
more of the physician, but knows that his disorder is without cure.
The best laid schemes are subject, however, to unlucky reverses.
Some such seem to lie in the way of that pleasing Euthanasia, and
contented submission to the grinding law of necessity, projected by
Mr. Malthus. We might never reach the philosophic temper of the
inhabitants of modern Greece and Turkey in this respect. Many
little things might happen to interrupt our progress, if we were put
into ever so fair a train. For instance, the men might perhaps be
talked over by the parson, and their understandings being convinced
by the geometrical and arithmetical ratios, or at least so far puzzled,
that they would have nothing to say for themselves, they might
prepare to submit to their fate with a tolerable grace. But I am
afraid that the women might prove refractory. They never will
hearken to reason, and are much more governed by their feelings than
by calculations. While the husband was instructing his wife in the
principles of population, she might probably answer that she did not
see why her children should starve when the squire’s lady, or the
parson’s lady kept half a dozen lap-dogs, and that it was but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>other day that being at the hall, or the parsonage house, she heard
Miss declare that not one of the brood that were just littered should
be drowned—It was <em>so inhuman</em> to kill the poor little things—Surely
the children of the poor are as good as puppy-dogs! Was it not a
week ago that the rector had a new pack of terriers sent down, and
did I not hear the squire swear a tremendous oath, that he would
have Mr. Such-a-one’s fine hunter, if it cost him a hundred guineas?
Half that sum would save us from ruin.—After this curtain-lecture,
I conceive that the husband might begin to doubt the force of the
demonstrations he had read and heard, and the next time his clerical
monitor came, might pluck up courage to question the matter with
him; and as we of the male sex, though dull of apprehension, are
not slow at taking a hint, and can draw tough inferences from it, it is
not impossible but the parson might be <em>gravelled</em>. In consequence of
these accidents happening more than once, it would be buzzed about
that the laws of God and nature, on which so many families had
been doomed to starve, were not so clear as had been pretended.
This would soon get wind among the mob: and at the next grand
procession of the Penitents of famine, headed by Mr. Malthus in
person, some discontented man of talents, who could not bear the
distresses of <em>others</em> with the fortitude of a man and the resignation of
a Christian, might undertake to question Mr. Malthus, whether the
laws of nature or of God, to which he had piously sacrificed so many
victims, signified any thing more than the limited extent of the earth,
and the natural impossibility of providing for more than a limited
number of human beings; and whether those laws could be justly
put in force, to the very letter, while the actual produce of the earth,
by being better husbanded, or more equally distributed, or given to
men and not to beasts, might maintain in comfort double the number
that actually existed, and who, not daring to demand a <em>fair</em> proportion
of the produce of their labour, humbly crave charity, and are
refused out of regard to the interests of justice and humanity. Our
philosopher, at this critical juncture not being able to bring into
the compass of a few words all the history, metaphysics, morality and
divinity, or all the intricacies, subtleties, and callous equivocations
contained in his quarto volume, might hesitate and be confounded—his
own feelings and prejudices might add to his perplexity—his
interrogator might persist in his question—the mob might become
impatient for an answer, and not finding one to their minds, might
proceed to extremities. Our unfortunate Essayist (who by that time
would have become a bishop) might be ordered to the lamp-post,
and his book committed to the flames.—I tremble to think of what
would follow:—the poor laws would be again renewed, and the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>no longer doomed to starve by the laws of God and nature! Some
such, I apprehend, might be the consequence of attempting to enforce
the abolition of the poor-laws, the extinction of private charity, and of
instructing the poor in their metaphysical rights. In a few years
time it is probable, however, that no such consequences would follow.
In that time, if Mr. Malthus’s systematic ardour will let him wait so
long, they may be gradually crushed low enough in the scale of
existence to be ripe for the ironical benefits, and sarcastic instruction
prepared for them. Mr. Malthus says,</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The scanty relief granted to persons in distress, the capricious and
insulting manner in which it is sometimes distributed by the overseers,
and the natural and becoming pride not yet quite extinct among
the peasantry of England, have deterred the more thinking and
virtuous part of them, from venturing on marriage, without some
better prospect of maintaining their families, than mere parish
assistance. The desire of bettering our condition and the fear of
making it worse, like the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</span></i> in physics, is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
medicatrix reipublicæ</span></i> in politics, and is continually counteracting the
disorders arising from narrow human institutions. In spite of the
prejudices in favour of population, and the direct encouragements to
marriage from the poor laws, it operates as a preventive check to
increase; and happy for this country is it that it does so.’</p>

<p class='c011'>If then this natural repugnance in the poor to subject themselves to
the necessity of parish relief has ceased to operate, must it not be
owing to extreme distress, or to the degradation of character, consequent
upon it? How does Mr. Malthus propose to remedy this?
By subjecting them to severe distress, and <em>teaching them patience under
their sufferings</em>. But the rational desire of bettering our condition and
the fear of making it worse is not increased by its being made worse.
The standard of our notions of decency and comfort is not raised by
a familiarity with unmitigated wretchedness, nor is the love of
independence heightened by insults, and contempt, and by a formal
mockery of the principles of justice and humanity. On the previous
habits and character of the people, it is, however, that the degree of
misery incurred always depends, as far as relates to themselves. The
consequence of an effectual abolition of the poor laws would be all the
immediate misery that would be produced, aggravated by the additional
depression, and proneness to misery in the lower classes, and a beautiful
putrefaction of all the common feelings of human nature in the higher
ones. Finally, I agree with Mr. Malthus, that, ‘if, as in Ireland
and in Spain, and many of the southern countries, the people be in so
degraded a state, as to propagate their species like brutes, it matters
little, whether they have poor laws or not. Misery in all its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>various forms must be the predominant check to their increase:
and with, or without poor laws, no stretch of human ingenuity and
exertion could rescue the people from the most extreme poverty and
wretchedness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the metaphysical subtleties, by which Mr. Malthus endeavours
to prove that we ought systematically to visit the sins of the father on
the children, and keep up the stock of vice and misery in the family
(from which it would follow, that the children of thieves and robbers
ought either to be hanged outright, or at least brought up in such a
manner as to ensure their following the fate of their parents) I feel
and know my own superiority on that ground so well, that it would
be ungenerous to push it farther. Mr. Malthus has a curious chapter
on old maids. He might have written one on suicides, and another
on prostitutes. As far as the question of population is concerned,
they are certainly of more service to the community, because they
tempt others to follow their example, whereas an old maid is a
beacon to frighten others into matrimony. But this, says our author,
is owing to unjust prejudice. I shall give the reader some of his
arguments, as otherwise he might not guess at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is not enough to abolish all the positive institutions which
encourage population; but we must endeavour, at the same time, to
correct the prevailing opinions, which have the same, or perhaps even
a more powerful, effect. The matron who has reared a family of ten or
twelve children, and whose sons, perhaps, may be fighting the battles
of their country, is apt to think that society owes her much; and
this imaginary debt, society is, in general, fully inclined to acknowledge.
But if the subject be fairly considered, and the respected
matron weighed in the scales of justice against the neglected old maid,
it is possible that the matron might kick the beam. She will appear
rather in the character of a monopolist, than of a great benefactor to
the state. If she had not married and had so many children, other
members of the society might have enjoyed this satisfaction; and
there is no particular reason for supposing that her sons would fight
better for their country than the sons of other women. She has
therefore rather subtracted from, than added to, the happiness of the
other part of society. The old maid, on the contrary, has exalted
others by depressing herself. Her self-denial has made room for
another marriage, without any additional distress; and she has not,
like the generality of men, in avoiding one error, fallen into its
opposite. She has really and truly contributed more to the happiness
of the rest of the society arising from the pleasures of marriage, than
if she had entered into this union herself, and had besides portioned
twenty maidens with a hundred pounds each; whose particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>happiness would have been balanced, either by an increase in the
general difficulties of rearing children and getting employment, or by
the necessity of celibacy in twenty other maidens somewhere else.
Like the truly benevolent man in an irremediable scarcity, she has
diminished her own consumption, instead of raising up a few particular
people, by pressing down the rest. On a fair comparison, therefore,
she seems to have a better founded claim to the gratitude of society
than the matron. Whether we could always completely sympathize
with the motives of her conduct, has not much to do with the
question. The particular motive which influenced the matron to
marry, was certainly not the good of her country. To refuse a
proper tribute of respect to the old maid, because she was not directly
influenced in her conduct by the desire of conferring on society a
certain benefit, which, though it must undoubtedly exist, must
necessarily be so diffused as to be invisible to her, is in the highest
degree impolitic and unjust. It is expecting a strain of virtue beyond
humanity. If we never reward any persons with our approbation,
but those who are exclusively influenced by motives of general
benevolence, this powerful encouragement to do good actions will not
be very often called into exercise.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus would make an excellent superior of a convent of
nuns of the Order of Population.—The better to remove what he
considers as an unjust stigma on old maids; he has endeavoured to
set one on married women. He would persuade every one to look
upon his mother as a person of bad character. He would pass an
act of bastardy on every mother’s son of us; and prove that we
come into the world without a proper license (from him) merely to
gratify the coarse, selfish, immoral propensities of our parents. Till
however he can do away the filial relation, or the respect attached
to it, or so contrive it that all men should be ‘born of a virgin’
contrary to all our experience, it will I believe be impossible to get
rid of the unjust prejudice against old maids, or to place them on a
level with married women. Mr. Malthus has gone the wrong way
to ingratiate himself with the mothers of families: but he has not
taken his measures ill. He knows that the partiality and favours of
such persons are generally confined to run in their own low, narrow,
domestic channels. But this is not the case with those reverend
persons, to whom he pays his court. He knows that their bounty
is not confined by any such selfish limits, it flows liberally to all,
and they have the best chance of sharing in it, who endeavour to
indemnify them for their personal sacrifices, or the ridicule of the
world by a succession of little agreeable attentions, or by offering
theoretical incense to their virtue and merit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>‘It is perfectly absurd as well as unjust, that a giddy girl of sixteen
should, because she is married be considered by the forms of society
as the protector of women of thirty, should come first into the room,
should be assigned the highest place at table, and be the prominent
figure to whom the attentions of the company are more particularly
addressed.’—Not more absurd than that a child or an ideot should
be a king, or that a grave man of fifty should call a young coxcomb,
My lord. Our sophist would overturn all the established order of
society with his out-of-the-way principles.—Mr. Malthus has huddled
into the same chapter his attack on the monopoly made by the
married women of the men, and his defence of the monopoly of corn
by farmers and others. It is the last passage I shall quote, though
there are many others worthy of rebuke.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In some conversations with labouring men during the late
scarcities, I confess that I was to the last degree disheartened, at
observing their inveterate prejudices on the subject of grain: and I
felt very strongly the almost absolute incompatibility of a government
really free, with such a degree of ignorance. The delusions are of
such a nature, that, if acted upon, they must, at all events, be
repressed by force: and it is extremely difficult to give such a
power to the government as will be sufficient at all times for this
purpose, without the risk of its being employed improperly, and
endangering the liberty of the subject. And this reflection cannot
but be disheartening to every friend to freedom.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is of the very utmost importance, that the gentlemen of the
country, and particularly the clergy, should not, from ignorance,
aggravate the evils of scarcity every time that it unfortunately occurs.
During the late dearths, half of the gentlemen and clergymen in the
kingdom richly deserved to have been prosecuted for sedition.
After inflaming the minds of the common people against the farmers
and corn-dealers, by the manner in which they talked of them, or
preached about them, it was but a feeble antidote to the poison which
they had infused, coldly to observe, that however the poor might be
oppressed or cheated, it was their duty to keep the peace. It was
little better than Antony’s repeated declaration, that the conspirators
were all honourable men; which did not save either their
houses or their persons from the attacks of the mob. Political
economy is perhaps the only science of which it might be said, that
the ignorance of it is not merely a deprivation of good, but produces
great positive evil.’</p>

<p class='c011'>I shall accompany this passage with an extract from the Author’s
first edition and leave it to the reader to apply the hint of
Antony’s speech to whom he thinks fit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>‘It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally
falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while
the nominal price of provisions has been gradually increasing. This
is, in effect, a real fall in the price of labour; and during this period,
the condition of the lower orders of the community must gradually
grow worse and worse. But the farmers and the capitalists are
growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increased
capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men. Work
therefore may be plentiful; and the price of labour would consequently
rise. But the want of freedom in the market of labour, which occurs
more or less in all communities, either from parish laws, or the more
general cause of the facility of combination among the rich, and its
difficulty among the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour from
rising at the natural period, and keeps it down some time longer;
perhaps, till a year of scarcity, when the clamour is too loud, and the
necessity too apparent to be resisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The true cause of the advance in the price of labour is thus
concealed; and the rich affect to grant it as an act of compassion and
favour to the poor, in consideration of a year of scarcity; and when
plenty returns, indulge themselves in the most unreasonable of all
complaints, that the price does not again fall; when a little reflection
would shew them, that it must have risen long before, but from an
unjust conspiracy of their own.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Published anonymously in one volume (8vo, 424 pages) in 1825, with the following
title-page:—‘The Spirit of the Age: or Contemporary Portraits. “To know
another well were to know one’s self.” London: Printed for Henry Colburn,
New Burlington Street. 1825.’ The imprint was ‘London: Printed by S. and
R. Bentley, Dorset Street.’ A second edition (here reproduced), with the same
title-page (except that the quotation ran: ‘“To know a man well, were to know
himself.” Hamlet’) and imprint, was produced in smaller type (8vo, 408 pages)
in the same year. In this edition the essays were arranged in a different order, an
addition was made to the essay on Coleridge, and an essay on Cobbett from <cite>Table
Talk</cite> (vol. i., 1821) was included. In the same year, 1825, an edition was published
in Paris (A. and W. Galignani) which included the essay on Cobbett and an essay
on Canning. The third edition, edited by the author’s son, was published in 1858
(one volume, 8vo, 396 pages, C. Templeman, Great Portland Street). In this
edition the essays on Cobbett and Canning were included, and the essays were
arranged in an order different from that of either the first or the second edition.
The fourth edition, edited by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt for Bohn’s <cite>Standard Library</cite>
(1886) restored the order of the second edition, but included the essay on Canning.
In this edition Mr. Hazlitt made some alterations in the text based upon (1)
portions of the original <span class='fss'>MSS.</span> then in his possession, and (2) autograph notes of
the author’s in a copy of the second edition belonging to Mr. C. W. Reynell. A
volume of <cite>Essays selected from The Spirit of the Age</cite>, with an introduction by R. B.
Johnson, was published in 1893 (the Knickerbocker Press, G. P. Putnam’s Sons).
Five of the essays, viz.: those on Bentham, Irving, Horne Tooke, Scott, and
Eldon were originally published in Colburn’s <cite>New Monthly Magazine and Literary
Journal</cite> (1824, vols. x. and xi.) in a series entitled ‘The Spirits of the Age.’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>JEREMY BENTHAM</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Bentham is one of those persons who verify the old adage, that
‘A prophet has most honour out of his own country.’ His reputation
lies at the circumference; and the lights of his understanding
are reflected, with increasing lustre, on the other side of the globe.
His name is little known in England, better in Europe, best of all
in the plains of Chili and the mines of Mexico. He has offered
constitutions for the New World, and legislated for future times.
The people of Westminster, where he lives, hardly dream of such
a person; but the Siberian savage has received cold comfort from
his lunar aspect, and may say to him with Caliban—‘I know thee,
and thy dog and thy bush!’ The tawny Indian may hold out the
hand of fellowship to him across the <span class='sc'>Great Pacific</span>. We believe
that the Empress Catherine corresponded with him; and we know
that the Emperor Alexander called upon him, and presented him
with his miniature in a gold snuff-box, which the philosopher, to his
eternal honour, returned. Mr. Hobhouse is a greater man at the
hustings, Lord Rolle at Plymouth Dock; but Mr. Bentham would
carry it hollow, on the score of popularity, at Paris or Pegu. The
reason is, that our author’s influence is purely intellectual. He has
devoted his life to the pursuit of abstract and general truths, and to
those studies—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That waft a <em>thought</em> from Indus to the Pole’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and has never mixed himself up with personal intrigues or party
politics. He once, indeed, stuck up a hand-bill to say that he
(Jeremy Bentham) being of sound mind, was of opinion that Sir
Samuel Romilly was the most proper person to represent Westminster;
but this was the whim of the moment. Otherwise, his reasonings,
if true at all, are true everywhere alike: his speculations concern
humanity at large, and are not confined to the hundred or the bills of
mortality. It is in moral as in physical magnitude. The little is
seen best near: the great appears in its proper dimensions, only from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>a more commanding point of view, and gains strength with time, and
elevation from distance!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bentham is very much among philosophers what La Fontaine
was among poets:—in general habits and in all but his professional
pursuits, he is a mere child. He has lived for the last forty years
in a house in Westminster, overlooking the Park, like an anchoret
in his cell, reducing law to a system, and the mind of man to a
machine. He scarcely ever goes out, and sees very little company.
The favoured few, who have the privilege of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i>, are always
admitted one by one. He does not like to have witnesses to his
conversation. He talks a great deal, and listens to nothing but facts.
When any one calls upon him, he invites them to take a turn round
his garden with him (Mr. Bentham is an economist of his time, and
sets apart this portion of it to air and exercise)—and there you may
see the lively old man, his mind still buoyant with thought and with
the prospect of futurity, in eager conversation with some Opposition
Member, some expatriated Patriot, or Transatlantic Adventurer,
urging the extinction of Close Boroughs, or planning a code of laws
for some ‘lone island in the watery waste,’ his walk almost amounting
to a run, his tongue keeping pace with it in shrill, cluttering
accents, negligent of his person, his dress, and his manner, intent
only on his grand theme of <span class='sc'>Utility</span>—or pausing, perhaps, for want
of breath and with lack-lustre eye to point out to the stranger a stone
in the wall at the end of his garden (overarched by two beautiful
cotton-trees) <em>Inscribed to the Prince of Poets</em>, which marks the house
where Milton formerly lived. To show how little the refinements
of taste or fancy enter into our author’s system, he proposed at one
time to cut down these beautiful trees, to convert the garden where
he had breathed the air of Truth and Heaven for near half a century
into a paltry <em>Chrestomathic School</em>, and to make Milton’s house (the
cradle of Paradise Lost) a thoroughfare, like a three-stalled stable,
for the idle rabble of Westminster to pass backwards and forwards
to it with their cloven hoofs. Let us not, however, be getting on
too fast—Milton himself taught school! There is something not
altogether dissimilar between Mr. Bentham’s appearance, and the
portraits of Milton, the same silvery tone, a few dishevelled hairs, a
peevish, yet puritanical expression, an irritable temperament corrected
by habit and discipline. Or in modern times, he is something
between Franklin and Charles Fox, with the comfortable double-chin
and sleek thriving look of the one, and the quivering lip, the restless
eye, and animated acuteness of the other. His eye is quick and
lively; but it glances not from object to object, but from thought to
thought. He is evidently a man occupied with some train of fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and inward association. He regards the people about him no more
than the flies of a summer. He meditates the coming age. He
hears and sees only what suits his purpose, or some ‘foregone
conclusion’; and looks out for facts and passing occurrences in order
to put them into his logical machinery and grind them into the dust
and powder of some subtle theory, as the miller looks out for grist to
his mill! Add to this physiognomical sketch the minor points of
costume, the open shirt-collar, the single-breasted coat, the old
fashioned half-boots and ribbed stockings; and you will find in Mr.
Bentham’s general appearance a singular mixture of boyish simplicity
and of the venerableness of age. In a word, our celebrated jurist
presents a striking illustration of the difference between the <em>philosophical</em>
and the <em>regal</em> look; that is, between the merely abstracted and the
merely personal. There is a lack-adaisical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i> about his whole
aspect, none of the fierceness of pride or power; an unconscious
neglect of his own person, instead of a stately assumption of
superiority; a good-humoured, placid intelligence, instead of a lynx-eyed
watchfulness, as if it wished to make others its prey, or was
afraid they might turn and rend him; he is a beneficent spirit, prying
into the universe, not lording it over it; a thoughtful spectator of
the scenes of life, or ruminator on the fate of mankind, not a painted
pageant, a stupid idol set up on its pedestal of pride for men to fall
down and worship with idiot fear and wonder at the thing themselves
have made, and which, without that fear and wonder, would in itself
be nothing!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bentham, perhaps, over-rates the importance of his own
theories. He has been heard to say (without any appearance of
pride or affectation) that ‘he should like to live the remaining years
of his life, a year at a time at the end of the next six or eight
centuries, to see the effect which his writings would by that time
have had upon the world.’ Alas! his name will hardly live so
long! Nor do we think, in point of fact, that Mr. Bentham has
given any new or decided impulse to the human mind. He cannot
be looked upon in the light of a discoverer in legislation or
morals. He has not struck out any great leading principle or parent-truth,
from which a number of others might be deduced; nor has
he enriched the common and established stock of intelligence with
original observations, like pearls thrown into wine. One truth
discovered is immortal, and entitles its author to be so: for, like a
new substance in nature, it cannot be destroyed. But Mr. Bentham’s
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is arrangement; and the form of truth, though not its essence,
varies with time and circumstance. He has methodised, collated,
and condensed all the materials prepared to his hand on the subjects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of which he treats, in a masterly and scientific manner; but we
should find a difficulty in adducing from his different works (however
elaborate or closely reasoned) any new element of thought, or even a
new fact or illustration. His writings are, therefore, chiefly valuable
as <em>books of reference</em>, as bringing down the account of intellectual
inquiry to the present period, and disposing the results in a compendious,
connected, and tangible shape; but books of reference are
chiefly serviceable for facilitating the acquisition of knowledge, and
are constantly liable to be superseded and to grow out of fashion with
its progress, as the scaffolding is thrown down as soon as the building
is completed. Mr. Bentham is not the first writer (by a great many)
who has assumed the principle of <span class='fss'>UTILITY</span> as the foundation of just
laws, and of all moral and political reasoning:—his merit is, that he
has applied this principle more closely and literally; that he has
brought all the objections and arguments, more distinctly labelled and
ticketed, under this one head, and made a more constant and explicit
reference to it at every step of his progress, than any other writer.
Perhaps the weak side of his conclusions also is, that he has carried
this single view of his subject too far, and not made sufficient allowance
for the varieties of human nature, and the caprices and irregularities
of the human will. ‘He has not allowed for the <em>wind</em>.’ It
is not that you can be said to see his favourite doctrine of Utility
glittering everywhere through his system, like a vein of rich, shining
ore (that is not the nature of the material)—but it might be plausibly
objected that he had struck the whole mass of fancy, prejudice,
passion, sense, whim, with his petrific, leaden mace, that he had
‘bound volatile Hermes,’ and reduced the theory and practice of
human life to a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of reason, and dull, plodding, technical
calculation. The gentleman is himself a capital logician; and he
has been led by this circumstance to consider man as a logical animal.
We fear this view of the matter will hardly hold water. If we attend
to the <em>moral</em> man, the constitution of his mind will scarcely be found
to be built up of pure reason and a regard to consequences: if we
consider the <em>criminal</em> man (with whom the legislator has chiefly to do)
it will be found to be still less so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every pleasure, says Mr. Bentham, is equally a good, and is to be
taken into the account as such in a moral estimate, whether it be the
pleasure of sense or of conscience, whether it arise from the exercise
of virtue or the perpetration of crime. We are afraid the human
mind does not readily come into this doctrine, this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio philosophorum</span></i>,
interpreted according to the letter. Our moral sentiments
are made up of sympathies and antipathies, of sense and imagination,
of understanding and prejudice. The soul, by reason of its weakness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>is an aggregating and an exclusive principle; it clings obstinately to
some things, and violently rejects others. And it must do so, in a
great measure, or it would act contrary to its own nature. It needs
helps and stages in its progress, and ‘all appliances and means to
boot,’ which can raise it to a partial conformity to truth and good
(the utmost it is capable of) and bring it into a tolerable harmony
with the universe. By aiming at too much, by dismissing collateral
aids, by extending itself to the farthest verge of the conceivable and
possible, it loses its elasticity and vigour, its impulse and its direction.
The moralist can no more do without the intermediate use of rules
and principles, without the ‘vantage ground of habit, without the
levers of the understanding, than the mechanist can discard the use of
wheels and pulleys, and perform every thing by simple motion. If
the mind of man were competent to comprehend the whole of
truth and good, and act upon it at once, and independently of all
other considerations, Mr. Bentham’s plan would be a feasible one,
and <em>the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth</em>, would be the
best possible ground to place morality upon. But it is not so. In
ascertaining the rules of moral conduct, we must have regard not
merely to the nature of the object, but to the capacity of the agent,
and to his fitness for apprehending or attaining it. Pleasure is that
which is so in itself: good is that which approves itself as such on
reflection, or the idea of which is a source of satisfaction. All
pleasure is not, therefore (morally speaking) equally a good; for all
pleasure does not equally bear reflecting on. There are some tastes
that are sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly; and there is a
similar contradiction and anomaly in the mind and heart of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, what would become of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Posthæc meminisse juvabit</span></i> of the
poet, if a principle of fluctuation and reaction is not inherent in the
very constitution of our nature, or if all moral truth is a mere literal
truism? We are not, then, so much to inquire what certain things
are abstractedly or in themselves, as how they affect the mind, and to
approve or condemn them accordingly. The same object seen near
strikes us more powerfully than at a distance: things thrown into
masses give a greater blow to the imagination than when scattered
and divided into their component parts. A number of mole-hills do
not make a mountain, though a mountain is actually made up of atoms:
so moral truth must present itself under a certain aspect and from a
certain point of view, in order to produce its full and proper effect
upon the mind. The laws of the affections are as necessary as those
of optics. A calculation of consequences is no more equivalent to a
sentiment, than a <em>seriatim</em> enumeration of square yards or feet touches
the fancy like the sight of the Alps or Andes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>To give an instance or two of what we mean. Those who on
pure cosmopolite principles, or on the ground of abstract humanity,
affect an extraordinary regard for the Turks and Tartars, have been
accused of neglecting their duties to their friends and next-door
neighbours. Well, then, what is the state of the question here?
One human being is, no doubt, as much worth in himself, independently
of the circumstances of time or place, as another; but he is
not of so much value to us and our affections. Could our imagination
take wing (with our speculative faculties) to the other side of the
globe or to the ends of the universe, could our eyes behold whatever
our reason teaches us to be possible, could our hands reach as far as
our thoughts and wishes, we might then busy ourselves to advantage
with the Hottentots, or hold intimate converse with the inhabitants of
the Moon; but being as we are, our feelings evaporate in so large a
space—we must draw the circle of our affections and duties somewhat
closer—the heart hovers and fixes nearer home. It is true, the bands
of private, or of local and natural affection, are often, nay in general,
too tightly strained, so as frequently to do harm instead of good: but
the present question is whether we can, with safety and effect, be
wholly emancipated from them? Whether we should shake them
off at pleasure and without mercy, as the only bar to the triumph of
truth and justice? Or whether benevolence, constructed upon a
logical scale, would not be merely <em>nominal</em>, whether duty, raised to
too lofty a pitch of refinement, might not sink into callous indifference
or hollow selfishness? Again, is it not to exact too high a strain
from humanity, to ask us to qualify the degree of abhorrence we feel
against a murderer by taking into our cool consideration the pleasure
he may have in committing the deed, and in the prospect of gratifying
his avarice or his revenge? We are hardly so formed as to sympathise
at the same moment with the assassin and his victim. The degree of
pleasure the former may feel, instead of extenuating, aggravates his
guilt, and shows the depth of his malignity. Now the mind revolts
against this by mere natural antipathy, if it is itself well-disposed; or
the slow process of reason would afford but a feeble resistance to
violence and wrong. The will, which is necessary to give consistency
and promptness to our good intentions, cannot extend so much
candour and courtesy to the antagonist principle of evil: virtue, to be
sincere and practical, cannot be divested entirely of the blindness and
impetuosity of passion! It has been made a plea (half jest, half
earnest) for the horrors of war, that they promote trade and manufactures.
It has been said, as a set-off for the atrocities practised
upon the negro slaves in the West Indies, that without their blood
and sweat, so many millions of people could not have sugar to sweeten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>their tea. Fires and murders have been argued to be beneficial, as
they serve to fill the newspapers, and for a subject to talk of—this is
a sort of sophistry that it might be difficult to disprove on the bare
scheme of contingent utility; but on the ground that we have stated,
it must pass for mere irony. What the proportion between the good
and the evil will really be found in any of the supposed cases, may be
a question to the understanding; but to the imagination and the
heart, that is, to the natural feelings of mankind, it admits of none!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bentham, in adjusting the provisions of a penal code, lays too
little stress on the co-operation of the natural prejudices of mankind,
and the habitual feelings of that class of persons for whom they are
more particularly designed. Legislators (we mean writers on legislation)
are philosophers, and governed by their reason: criminals, for
whose controul laws are made, are a set of desperadoes, governed
only by their passions. What wonder that so little progress has been
made towards a mutual understanding between the two parties!
They are quite a different species, and speak a different language,
and are sadly at a loss for a common interpreter between them.
Perhaps the Ordinary of Newgate bids as fair for this office as any
one. What should Mr. Bentham, sitting at ease in his arm-chair,
composing his mind before he begins to write by a prelude on the
organ, and looking out at a beautiful prospect when he is at a loss for
an idea, know of the principles of action of rogues, outlaws, and
vagabonds? No more than Montaigne of the motions of his cat!
If sanguine and tender-hearted philanthropists have set on foot an
inquiry into the barbarity and the defects of penal laws, the practical
improvements have been mostly suggested by reformed cut-throats,
turnkeys, and thief-takers. What even can the Honourable House,
who when the Speaker has pronounced the well-known, wished-for
sounds, ‘That this house do now adjourn,’ retire, after voting a
royal crusade or a loan of millions, to lie on down, and feed on
plate in spacious palaces, know of what passes in the hearts of
wretches in garrets and night-cellars, petty pilferers and marauders,
who cut throats and pick pockets with their own hands? The
thing is impossible. The laws of the country are, therefore, ineffectual
and abortive, because they are made by the rich for the poor, by the
wise for the ignorant, by the respectable and exalted in station for the
very scum and refuse of the community. If Newgate would resolve
itself into a committee of the whole Press-yard, with Jack Ketch at
its head, aided by confidential persons from the county prisons or the
Hulks, and would make a clear breast, some <em>data</em> might be found out
to proceed upon; but as it is, the <em>criminal mind</em> of the country is a
book sealed, no one has been able to penetrate to the inside!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Mr. Bentham, in his attempts to revise and amend our criminal
jurisprudence, proceeds entirely on his favourite principle of Utility.
Convince highwaymen and housebreakers that it will be for their
interest to reform, and they will reform and lead honest lives;
according to Mr. Bentham. He says, ‘All men act from calculation,
even madmen reason.’ And, in our opinion, he might as well carry
this maxim to Bedlam or St. Luke’s, and apply it to the inhabitants,
as think to coerce or overawe the inmates of a gaol, or those whose
practices make them candidates for that distinction, by the mere dry,
detailed convictions of the understanding. Criminals are not to be
influenced by reason; for it is of the very essence of crime to
disregard consequences both to ourselves and others. You may as
well preach philosophy to a drunken man, or to the dead, as to those
who are under the instigation of any mischievous passion. A man is
a drunkard, and you tell him he ought to be sober; he is debauched,
and you ask him to reform; he is idle, and you recommend industry
to him as his wisest course; he gambles, and you remind him that he
may be ruined by this foible; he has lost his character, and you
advise him to get into some reputable service or lucrative situation;
vice becomes a habit with him, and you request him to rouse himself
and shake it off; he is starving, and you warn him if he breaks the
law, he will be hanged. None of this reasoning reaches the mark it
aims at. The culprit, who violates and suffers the vengeance of the
laws, is not the dupe of ignorance, but the slave of passion, the victim
of habit or necessity. To argue with strong passion, with inveterate
habit, with desperate circumstances, is to talk to the winds. Clownish
ignorance may indeed be dispelled, and taught better; but it is seldom
that a criminal is not aware of the consequences of his act, or has not
made up his mind to the alternative. They are, in general, <em>too
knowing by half</em>. You tell a person of this stamp what is his interest;
he says he does not care about his interest, or the world and he differ
on that particular. But there is one point on which he must agree
with them, namely, what <em>they</em> think of his conduct, and that is the
only hold you have of him. A man may be callous and indifferent
to what happens to himself; but he is never indifferent to public
opinion, or proof against open scorn and infamy. Shame, then, not
fear, is the sheet-anchor of the law. He who is not afraid of being
pointed at as a <em>thief</em>, will not mind a month’s hard labour. He who
is prepared to take the life of another, is already reckless of his own.
But every one makes a sorry figure in the pillory; and the being
launched from the New Drop lowers a man in his own opinion.
The lawless and violent spirit, who is hurried by headstrong self-will
to break the laws, does not like to have the ground of pride and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>obstinacy struck from under his feet. This is what gives the <em>swells</em>
of the metropolis such a dread of the <em>tread-mill</em>—it makes them
ridiculous. It must be confessed, that this very circumstance renders
the reform of criminals nearly hopeless. It is the apprehension of
being stigmatized by public opinion, the fear of what will be thought
and said of them, that deters men from the violation of the laws,
while their character remains unimpeached; but honour once lost, all
is lost. The man can never be himself again! A citizen is like a
soldier, a part of a machine, who submits to certain hardships,
privations, and dangers, not for his own ease, pleasure, profit, or even
conscience, but—<em>for shame</em>. What is it that keeps the machine
together in either case? Not punishment or discipline, but sympathy.
The soldier mounts the breach or stands in the trenches, the peasant
hedges and ditches, or the mechanic plies his ceaseless task, because
the one will not be called a <em>coward</em>, the other a <em>rogue</em>: but let the
one turn deserter and the other vagabond, and there is an end of him.
The grinding law of necessity, which is no other than a name, a
breath, loses its force; he is no longer sustained by the good opinion
of others, and he drops out of his place in society, a useless clog!
Mr. Bentham takes a culprit, and puts him into what he calls a
<em>Panopticon</em>, that is, a sort of circular prison, with open cells, like
a glass bee-hive. He sits in the middle, and sees all the other does.
He gives him work to do, and lectures him if he does not do it.
He takes liquor from him, and society and liberty; but he feeds and
clothes him, and keeps him out of mischief; and when he has
convinced him, by force and reason together, that this life is for
his good, he turns him out upon the world a reformed man, and as
confident of the success of his handy-work, as the shoemaker of that
which he has just taken off the last, or the Parisian barber in Sterne,
of the buckle of his wig. ‘Dip it in the ocean,’ said the perruquier,
‘and it will stand!’ But we doubt the durability of our projector’s
patchwork. Will our convert to the great principle of Utility work
when he is from under Mr. Bentham’s eye, because he was forced to
work when under it? Will he keep sober, because he has been kept
from liquor so long? Will he not return to loose company, because
he has had the pleasure of sitting <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</span> with a philosopher of late?
Will he not steal, now that his hands are untied? Will he not take
the road, now that it is free to him? Will he not call his benefactor
all the names he can set his tongue to, the moment his back is
turned? All this is more than to be feared. The charm of criminal
life, like that of savage life, consists in liberty, in hardship, in danger,
and in the contempt of death, in one word, in extraordinary excitement;
and he who has tasted of it, will no more return to regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>habits of life, than a man will take to water after drinking brandy, or
than a wild beast will give over hunting its prey. Miracles never
cease, to be sure; but they are not to be had wholesale, or <em>to order</em>.
Mr. Owen, who is another of those proprietors and patentees of
reform, has lately got an American savage with him, whom he carries
about in great triumph and complacency, as an antithesis to his
<cite>New View of Society</cite>, and as winding up his reasoning to what it
mainly wanted, an epigrammatic point. Does the benevolent visionary
of the Lanark cotton-mills really think this <em>natural man</em> will act as
a foil to his <em>artificial man</em>? Does he for a moment imagine that his
<cite>Address to the higher and middle classes</cite>, with all its advantages of
fiction, makes any thing like so interesting a romance as <cite>Hunter’s
Captivity among the North American Indians</cite>? Has he any thing to
show, in all the apparatus of New Lanark and its desolate monotony,
to excite the thrill of imagination like the blankets made of wreaths
of snow under which the wild wood-rovers bury themselves for weeks
in winter? Or the skin of a leopard, which our hardy adventurer
slew, and which served him for great-coat and bedding? Or the
rattle-snake that he found by his side as a bedfellow? Or his rolling
himself into a ball to escape from him? Or his suddenly placing
himself against a tree to avoid being trampled to death by the herd of
wild buffaloes, that came rushing on like the sound of thunder? Or
his account of the huge spiders that prey on blue-bottles and gilded
flies in green pathless forests; or of the great Pacific Ocean, that the
natives look upon as the gulf that parts time from eternity, and that
is to waft them to the spirits of their fathers? After all this,
Mr. Hunter must find Mr. Owen and his parallelograms trite and
flat, and will, we suspect, take an opportunity to escape from them!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bentham’s method of reasoning, though comprehensive and
exact, labours under the defect of most systems—it is too <em>topical</em>.
It includes every thing; but it includes every thing alike. It is
rather like an inventory, than a valuation of different arguments.
Every possible suggestion finds a place, so that the mind is distracted
as much as enlightened by this perplexing accuracy. The exceptions
seem as important as the rule. By attending to the minute, we
overlook the great; and in summing up an account, it will not do
merely to insist on the number of items without considering their
amount. Our author’s page presents a very nicely dove-tailed mosaic
pavement of legal common-places. We slip and slide over its even
surface without being arrested any where. Or his view of the
human mind resembles a map, rather than a picture: the outline,
the disposition is correct, but it wants colouring and relief. There
is a technicality of manner, which renders his writings of more value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>to the professional inquirer than to the general reader. Again, his
style is unpopular, not to say unintelligible. He writes a language of
his own, that <em>darkens knowledge</em>. His works have been translated
into French—they ought to be translated into English. People
wonder that Mr. Bentham has not been prosecuted for the boldness
and severity of some of his invectives. He might wrap up high
treason in one of his inextricable periods, and it would never find its
way into Westminster-Hall. He is a kind of Manuscript author—he
writes a cypher-hand, which the vulgar have no key to. The
construction of his sentences is a curious frame-work with pegs and
hooks to hang his thoughts upon, for his own use and guidance, but
almost out of the reach of every body else. It is a barbarous
philosophical jargon, with all the repetitions, parentheses, formalities,
uncouth nomenclature and verbiage of law-Latin; and what makes it
worse, it is not mere verbiage, but has a great deal of acuteness and
meaning in it, which you would be glad to pick out if you could.
In short, Mr. Bentham writes as if he was allowed but a single
sentence to express his whole view of a subject in, and as if, should
he omit a single circumstance or step of the argument, it would be
lost to the world for ever, like an estate by a flaw in the title-deeds.
This is over-rating the importance of our own discoveries, and
mistaking the nature and object of language altogether. Mr. Bentham
has <em>acquired</em> this disability—it is not natural to him. His admirable
little work <cite>On Usury</cite>, published forty years ago, is clear, easy, and
vigorous. But Mr. Bentham has shut himself up since then ‘in nook
monastic,’ conversing only with followers of his own, or with ‘men
of Ind,’ and has endeavoured to overlay his natural humour, sense,
spirit, and style, with the dust and cobwebs of an obscure solitude.
The best of it is, he thinks his present mode of expressing himself
perfect, and that whatever may be objected to his law or logic, no
one can find the least fault with the purity, simplicity, and perspicuity
of his style.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bentham, in private life, is an amiable and exemplary character.
He is a little romantic, or so; and has dissipated part of a
handsome fortune in practical speculations. He lends an ear to
plausible projectors, and, if he cannot prove them to be wrong in
their premises or their conclusions, thinks himself bound <em>in reason</em> to
stake his money on the venture. Strict logicians are licenced visionaries.
Mr. Bentham is half-brother to the late Mr. Speaker Abbott<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a>—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proh
pudor!</span></i> He was educated at Eton, and still takes our novices
to task about a passage in Homer, or a metre in Virgil. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>afterwards at the University, and he has described the scruples of an
ingenuous youthful mind about subscribing the articles, in a passage
in his <cite>Church-of-Englandism</cite>, which smacks of truth and honour both,
and does one good to read it in an age, when ‘to be honest’ (or not
to laugh at the very idea of honesty) ‘is to be one man picked out
of ten thousand!’ Mr. Bentham relieves his mind sometimes, after
the fatigue of study, by playing on a fine old organ, and has a relish
for Hogarth’s prints. He turns wooden utensils in a lathe for
exercise, and fancies he can turn men in the same manner. He has
no great fondness for poetry, and can hardly extract a moral out of
Shakespeare. His house is warmed and lighted by steam. He is
one of those who prefer the artificial to the natural in most things,
and think the mind of man omnipotent. He has a great contempt
for out-of-door prospects, for green fields and trees, and is for referring
every thing to Utility. There is a little narrowness in this; for if
all the sources of satisfaction are taken away, what is to become of
utility itself? It is, indeed, the great fault of this able and extraordinary
man, that he has concentrated his faculties and feelings too
entirely on one subject and pursuit, and has not ‘looked enough
abroad into universality.’<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c003'>WILLIAM GODWIN</h3>

<p class='c008'>The Spirit of the Age was never more fully shown than in its
treatment of this writer—its love of paradox and change, its dastard
submission to prejudice and to the fashion of the day. Five-and-twenty
years ago he was in the very zenith of a sultry and unwholesome
popularity; he blazed as a sun in the firmament of reputation;
no one was more talked of, more looked up to, more sought after,
and wherever liberty, truth, justice was the theme, his name was not
far off:—now he has sunk below the horizon, and enjoys the serene
twilight of a doubtful immortality. Mr. Godwin, during his life-time,
has secured to himself the triumphs and the mortifications of an
extreme notoriety and of a sort of posthumous fame. His bark,
after being tossed in the revolutionary tempest, now raised to heaven
by all the fury of popular breath, now almost dashed in pieces, and
buried in the quicksands of ignorance, or scorched with the lightning
of momentary indignation, at length floats on the calm wave that is
to bear it down the stream of time. Mr. Godwin’s person is not
known, he is not pointed out in the street, his conversation is not
courted, his opinions are not asked, he is at the head of no cabal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>he belongs to no party in the State, he has no train of admirers, no
one thinks it worth his while even to traduce and vilify him, he has
scarcely friend or foe, the world make a point (as Goldsmith used
to say) of taking no more notice of him than if such an individual
had never existed; he is to all ordinary intents and purposes dead
and buried; but the author of <cite>Political Justice</cite> and of <cite>Caleb Williams</cite>
can never die, his name is an abstraction in letters, his works are
standard in the history of intellect. He is thought of now like any
eminent writer a hundred-and-fifty years ago, or just as he will be
a hundred-and-fifty years hence. He knows this, and smiles in silent
mockery of himself, reposing on the monument of his fame—</p>

<p class='c011'>No work in our time gave such a blow to the philosophical mind
of the country as the celebrated <cite>Enquiry concerning Political Justice</cite>.
Tom Paine was considered for the time as a Tom Fool to him;
Paley an old woman; Edmund Burke a flashy sophist. Truth,
moral truth, it was supposed, had here taken up its abode; and these
were the oracles of thought. ‘Throw aside your books of chemistry,’
said Wordsworth to a young man, a student in the Temple, ‘and
read Godwin on Necessity.’ Sad necessity! Fatal reverse! Is
truth then so variable? Is it one thing at twenty, and another at
forty? Is it at a burning heat in 1793, and below <em>zero</em> in 1814?
Not so, in the name of manhood and of common sense! Let us
pause here a little.—Mr. Godwin indulged in extreme opinions, and
carried with him all the most sanguine and fearless understandings of
the time. What then? Because those opinions were overcharged,
were they therefore altogether groundless? Is the very God of our
idolatry all of a sudden to become an abomination and an anathema?
Could so many young men of talent, of education, and of principle
have been hurried away by what had neither truth, nor nature, not
one particle of honest feeling nor the least show of reason in it?
Is the <cite>Modern Philosophy</cite> (as it has been called) at one moment
a youthful bride, and the next a withered beldame, like the false
Duessa in Spenser? Or is the vaunted edifice of Reason, like his
House of Pride, gorgeous in front, and dazzling to approach, while
‘its hinder parts are ruinous, decayed, and old?’ Has the main
prop, which supported the mighty fabric, been shaken and given
way under the strong grasp of some Samson; or has it not rather
been undermined by rats and vermin? At one time, it almost
seemed, that ‘if this failed,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The pillar’d firmament was rottenness,</div>
      <div class='line'>And earth’s base built of stubble:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>now scarce a shadow of it remains, it is crumbled to dust, nor is it
even talked of! ‘What, then, went ye forth for to see, a reed
shaken with the wind?’ Was it for this that our young gownsmen
of the greatest expectation and promise, versed in classic lore, steeped
in dialectics, armed at all points for the foe, well read, well nurtured,
well provided for, left the University and the prospect of lawn sleeves,
tearing asunder the shackles of the free born spirit, and the cobwebs
of school-divinity, to throw themselves at the feet of the new
Gamaliel, and learn wisdom from him? Was it for this, that
students at the bar, acute, inquisitive, sceptical (here only wild
enthusiasts) neglected for a while the paths of preferment and the
law as too narrow, tortuous, and unseemly to bear the pure and broad
light of reason? Was it for this, that students in medicine missed
their way to Lecturerships and the top of their profession, deeming
lightly of the health of the body, and dreaming only of the renovation
of society and the march of mind? Was it to this that Mr.
Southey’s <cite>Inscriptions</cite> pointed? to this that Mr. Coleridge’s <cite>Religious
Musings</cite> tended? Was it for this, that Mr. Godwin himself sat
with arms folded, and, ‘like Cato, gave his little senate laws?’
Or rather, like another Prospero, uttered syllables that with their
enchanted breath were to change the world, and might almost stop
the stars in their courses? Oh! and is all forgot? Is this sun of
intellect blotted from the sky? Or has it suffered total eclipse?
Or is it we who make the fancied gloom, by looking at it through
the paltry, broken, stained fragments of our own interests and prejudices?
Were we fools then, or are we dishonest now? Or was
the impulse of the mind less likely to be true and sound when it arose from
high thought and warm feeling, than afterwards, when it was warped
and debased by the example, the vices, and follies of the world?</p>

<p class='c011'>The fault, then, of Mr. Godwin’s philosophy, in one word, was
too much ambition—‘by that sin fell the angels!’ He conceived too
nobly of his fellows (the most unpardonable crime against them, for
there is nothing that annoys our self-love so much as being complimented
on imaginary achievements, to which we are wholly unequal)—he
raised the standard of morality above the reach of humanity,
and by directing virtue to the most airy and romantic heights, made
her path dangerous, solitary, and impracticable. The author of the
<cite>Political Justice</cite> took abstract reason for the rule of conduct, and
abstract good for its end. He places the human mind on an elevation,
from which it commands a view of the whole line of moral consequences;
and requires it to conform its acts to the larger and more
enlightened conscience which it has thus acquired. He absolves man
from the gross and narrow ties of sense, custom, authority, private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and local attachment, in order that he may devote himself to the
boundless pursuit of universal benevolence. Mr. Godwin gives no
quarter to the amiable weaknesses of our nature, nor does he stoop to
avail himself of the supplementary aids of an imperfect virtue.
Gratitude, promises, friendship, family affection give way, not that
they may be merged in the opposite vices or in want of principle; but
that the void may be filled up by the disinterested love of good, and
the dictates of inflexible justice, which is ‘the law of laws, and
sovereign of sovereigns.’ All minor considerations yield, in his
system, to the stern sense of duty, as they do, in the ordinary and
established ones, to the voice of necessity. Mr. Godwin’s theory,
and that of more approved reasoners, differ only in this, that what are
with them the exceptions, the extreme cases, he makes the every-day
rule. No one denies that on great occasions, in moments of fearful
excitement, or when a mighty object is at stake, the lesser and merely
instrumental points of duty are to be sacrificed without remorse at the
shrine of patriotism, of honour, and of conscience. But the disciple
of the <em>New School</em> (no wonder it found so many impugners, even in
its own bosom!) is to be always the hero of duty; the law to which
he has bound himself never swerves nor relaxes; his feeling of what
is right is to be at all times wrought up to a pitch of enthusiastic self-devotion;
he must become the unshrinking martyr and confessor of
the public good. If it be said that this scheme is chimerical and
impracticable on ordinary occasions, and to the generality of mankind,
well and good; but those who accuse the author of having trampled
on the common feelings and prejudices of mankind in wantonness or
insult, or without wishing to substitute something better (and only
unattainable, because it is better) in their stead, accuse him wrongfully.
We may not be able to launch the bark of our affections on the ocean-tide
of humanity, we may be forced to paddle along its shores, or
shelter in its creeks and rivulets: but we have no right to reproach
the bold and adventurous pilot, who dared us to tempt the uncertain
abyss, with our own want of courage or of skill, or with the jealousies
and impatience, which deter us from undertaking, or might prevent us
from accomplishing the voyage!</p>

<p class='c011'>The <cite>Enquiry concerning Political Justice</cite> (it was urged by its
favourers and defenders at the time, and may still be so, without
either profaneness or levity) is a metaphysical and logical commentary
on some of the most beautiful and striking texts of Scripture. Mr.
Godwin is a mixture of the Stoic and of the Christian philosopher.
To break the force of the vulgar objections and outcry that have been
raised against the Modern Philosophy, as if it were a new and
monstrous birth in morals, it may be worth noticing, that volumes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>sermons have been written to excuse the founder of Christianity for
not including friendship and private affection among its golden rules,
but rather excluding them.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Moreover, the answer to the question,
‘Who is thy neighbour?’ added to the divine precept, ‘Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself,’ is the same as in the exploded pages of
our author,—‘He to whom we can do most good.’ In determining
this point, we were not to be influenced by any extrinsic or collateral
considerations, by our own predilections, or the expectations of others,
by our obligations to them or any services they might be able to render
us, by the climate they were born in, by the house they lived in, by
rank or religion, or party, or personal ties, but by the abstract merits,
the pure and unbiassed justice of the case. The artificial helps and
checks to moral conduct were set aside as spurious and unnecessary,
and we came at once to the grand and simple question—‘In what
manner we could best contribute to the greatest possible good?’
This was the paramount obligation in all cases whatever, from which
we had no right to free ourselves upon any idle or formal pretext,
and of which each person was to judge for himself, under the infallible
authority of his own opinion and the inviolable sanction of his self-approbation.
‘There was the rub that made <em>philosophy</em> of so short
life!’ Mr. Godwin’s definition of morals was the same as the
admired one of law, <em>reason without passion</em>; but with the unlimited
scope of private opinion, and in a boundless field of speculation (for
nothing less would satisfy the pretensions of the New School), there
was danger that the unseasoned novice might substitute some pragmatical
conceit of his own for the rule of right reason, and mistake a
heartless indifference for a superiority to more natural and generous
feelings. Our ardent and dauntless reformer followed out the moral
of the parable of the Good Samaritan into its most rigid and repulsive
consequences with a pen of steel, and let fall his ‘trenchant-blade’ on
every vulnerable point of human infirmity; but there is a want in his
system of the mild and persuasive tone of the Gospel, where ‘all is
conscience and tender heart.’ Man was indeed screwed up, by mood
and figure, into a logical machine, that was to forward the public
good with the utmost punctuality and effect, and it might go very
well on smooth ground and under favourable circumstances; but
would it work up-hill or <em>against the grain</em>? It was to be feared that
the proud Temple of Reason, which at a distance and in stately
supposition shone like the palaces of the New Jerusalem, might (when
placed on actual ground) be broken up into the sordid styes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>sensuality, and the petty huckster’s shops of self-interest! Every
man (it was proposed—‘so ran the tenour of the bond’) was to be a
Regulus, a Codrus, a Cato, or a Brutus—every woman a Mother of
the Gracchi.</p>

<p class='c015'>But heroes on paper might degenerate into vagabonds in practice,
Corinnas into courtezans. Thus a refined and permanent individual
attachment is intended to supply the place and avoid the inconveniences
of marriage; but vows of eternal constancy, without church
security, are found to be fragile. A member of the <em>ideal</em> and perfect
commonwealth of letters lends another a hundred pounds for immediate
and pressing use; and when he applies for it again, the borrower
has still more need of it than he, and retains it for his own especial,
which is tantamount to the public good. The Exchequer of pure
reason, like that of the State, never refunds. The political as well as
the religious fanatic appeals from the over-weening opinion and claims
of others to the highest and most impartial tribunal, namely, his own
breast. Two persons agree to live together in Chambers on principles
of pure equality and mutual assistance—but when it comes to the
push, one of them finds that the other always insists on his fetching
water from the pump in Hare-court, and cleaning his shoes for him.
A modest assurance was not the least indispensable virtue in the new
perfectibility code; and it was hence discovered to be a scheme, like
other schemes where there are all prizes and no blanks, for the
accommodation of the enterprizing and cunning, at the expence of the
credulous and honest. This broke up the system, and left no good
odour behind it! Reason has become a sort of bye-word, and
philosophy has, ‘fallen first into a fasting, then into a sadness, then into
a decline, and last, into the dissolution of which we all complain!’
This is a worse error than the former: we may be said to have ‘lost
the immortal part of ourselves, and what remains is beastly!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The point of view from which this matter may be fairly considered,
is two-fold, and may be stated thus:—In the first place, it by no
means follows, because reason is found not to be the only infallible or safe
rule of conduct, that it is no rule at all; or that we are to discard it
altogether with derision and ignominy. On the contrary, if not the
sole, it is the principal ground of action; it is, ‘the guide, the stay
and anchor of our purest thoughts, and soul of all our moral being.’
In proportion as we strengthen and expand this principle, and bring
our affections and subordinate, but perhaps more powerful motives of
action into harmony with it, it will not admit of a doubt that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>advance to the goal of perfection, and answer the ends of our creation,
those ends which not only morality enjoins, but which religion
sanctions. If with the utmost stretch of reason, man cannot (as some
seemed inclined to suppose) soar up to the God, and quit the ground
of human frailty, yet, stripped wholly of it, he sinks at once into the
brute. If it cannot stand alone, in its naked simplicity, but requires
other props to buttress it up, or ornaments to set it off; yet without
it the moral structure would fall flat and dishonoured to the
ground. Private reason is that which raises the individual above
his mere animal instincts, appetites, and passions: public reason in
its gradual progress separates the savage from the civilized state.
Without the one, men would resemble wild beasts in their dens;
without the other, they would be speedily converted into hordes
of barbarians or banditti. Sir Walter Scott, in his zeal to restore
the spirit of loyalty, of passive obedience and non-resistance as
an acknowledgment for his having been created a Baronet by a
Prince of the House of Brunswick, may think it a fine thing to
return in imagination to the good old times, ‘when in Auvergne
alone, there were three hundred nobles whose most ordinary actions
were robbery, rape, and murder,’ when the castle of each Norman
baron was a strong hold from which the lordly proprietor issued
to oppress and plunder the neighbouring districts, and when the
Saxon peasantry were treated by their gay and gallant tyrants as
a herd of loathsome swine—but for our own parts, we beg to be
excused; we had rather live in the same age with the author of
Waverley and Blackwood’s Magazine. Reason is the meter and
alnager in civil intercourse, by which each person’s upstart and contradictory
pretensions are weighed and approved or found wanting,
and without which it could not subsist, any more than traffic or the
exchange of commodities could be carried on without weights and
measures. It is the medium of knowledge, and the polisher of
manners, by creating common interests and ideas. Or in the words
of a contemporary writer, ‘Reason is the queen of the moral world,
the soul of the universe, the lamp of human life, the pillar of society,
the foundation of law, the beacon of nations, the golden chain let
down from heaven, which links all accountable and all intelligent
natures in one common system—and in the vain strife between fanatic
innovation and fanatic prejudice, we are exhorted to dethrone this
queen of the world, to blot out this light of the mind, to deface this
fair column, to break in pieces this golden chain! We are to discard
and throw from us with loud taunts and bitter execrations that reason,
which has been the lofty theme of the philosopher, the poet, the
moralist, and the divine, whose name was not first named to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>abused by the enthusiasts of the French Revolution, or to be blasphemed
by the madder enthusiasts, the advocates of Divine Right,
but which is coeval with, and inseparable from the nature and faculties
of man—is the image of his Maker stamped upon him at his birth,
the understanding breathed into him with the breath of life, and in
the participation and improvement of which alone he is raised above
the brute creation and his own physical nature!’—The overstrained
and ridiculous pretensions of monks and ascetics were never thought
to justify a return to unbridled licence of manners, or the throwing
aside of all decency. The hypocrisy, cruelty, and fanaticism, often
attendant on peculiar professions of sanctity, have not banished the
name of religion from the world. Neither can ‘the unreasonableness
of the reason’ of some modern sciolists so ‘unreason our reason,’ as
to debar us of the benefit of this principle in future, or to disfranchise
us of the highest privilege of our nature. In the second
place, if it is admitted that Reason alone is not the sole and self-sufficient
ground of morals, it is to Mr. Godwin that we are indebted
for having settled the point. No one denied or distrusted this
principle (before his time) as the absolute judge and interpreter in
all questions of difficulty; and if this is no longer the case, it is
because he has taken this principle, and followed it into its remotest
consequences with more keenness of eye and steadiness of hand than
any other expounder of ethics. His grand work is (at least) an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</span></i> to show the weak sides and imperfections of
human reason as the sole law of human action. By overshooting the
mark, or by ‘flying an eagle flight, forth and right on,’ he has
pointed out the limit or line of separation, between what is practicable
and what is barely conceivable—by imposing impossible tasks on the
naked strength of the will, he has discovered how far it is or is not
in our power to dispense with the illusions of sense, to resist the calls
of affection, to emancipate ourselves from the force of habit; and
thus, though he has not said it himself, has enabled others to say to
the towering aspirations after good, and to the over-bearing pride
of human intellect—‘Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther!’
Captain Parry would be thought to have rendered a service to navigation
and his country, no less by proving that there is no North-West
Passage, than if he had ascertained that there is one: so Mr. Godwin
has rendered an essential service to moral science, by attempting (in
vain) to pass the Arctic Circle and Frozen Regions, where the
understanding is no longer warmed by the affections, nor fanned by the
breeze of fancy! This is the effect of all bold, original, and powerful
thinking, that it either discovers the truth, or detects where error
lies; and the only crime with which Mr. Godwin can be charged as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>a political and moral reasoner is, that he has displayed a more ardent
spirit, and a more independent activity of thought than others, in
establishing the fallacy (if fallacy it be) of an old popular prejudice
that <em>the Just and True were one</em>, by ‘championing it to the Outrance,’
and in the final result placing the Gothic structure of human virtue on
an humbler, but a wider and safer foundation than it had hitherto
occupied in the volumes and systems of the learned.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Godwin is an inventor in the regions of romance, as well as
a skilful and hardy explorer of those of moral truth. <cite>Caleb Williams</cite>
and <cite>St. Leon</cite> are two of the most splendid and impressive works of
the imagination that have appeared in our times. It is not merely
that these novels are very well for a philosopher to have produced—they
are admirable and complete in themselves, and would not lead
you to suppose that the author, who is so entirely at home in human
character and dramatic situation, had ever dabbled in logic or metaphysics.
The first of these, particularly, is a masterpiece, both as to
invention and execution. The romantic and chivalrous principle of
the love of personal fame is embodied in the finest possible manner in
the character of Falkland<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a>; as in Caleb Williams (who is not the
first, but the second character in the piece) we see the very demon of
curiosity personified. Perhaps the art with which these two characters
are contrived to relieve and set off each other, has never been
surpassed in any work of fiction, with the exception of the immortal
satire of Cervantes. The restless and inquisitive spirit of Caleb
Williams, in search and in possession of his patron’s fatal secret,
haunts the latter like a second conscience, plants stings in his tortured
mind, fans the flames of his jealous ambition, struggling with agonized
remorse; and the hapless but noble-minded Falkland at length falls
a martyr to the persecution of that morbid and overpowering interest,
of which his mingled virtues and vices have rendered him the object.
We conceive no one ever began Caleb Williams that did not read it
through: no one that ever read it could possibly forget it, or speak of
it after any length of time but with an impression as if the events and
feelings had been personal to himself. This is the case also with
the story of St. Leon, which, with less dramatic interest and intensity
of purpose, is set off by a more gorgeous and flowing eloquence, and
by a crown of preternatural imagery, that waves over it like a palm-tree!
It is the beauty and the charm of Mr. Godwin’s descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>that the reader identifies himself with the author; and the secret of
this is, that the author has identified himself with his personages.
Indeed, he has created them. They are the proper issue of his
brain, lawfully begot, not foundlings, nor the ‘bastards of his art.’
He is not an indifferent, callous spectator of the scenes which he
himself pourtrays, but without seeming to feel them. There is no
look of patchwork and plagiarism, the beggarly copiousness of
borrowed wealth; no tracery-work from worm-eaten manuscripts,
from forgotten chronicles, nor piecing out of vague traditions with
fragments and snatches of old ballads, so that the result resembles a
gaudy, staring transparency, in which you cannot distinguish the
daubing of the painter from the light that shines through the flimsy
colours and gives them brilliancy. Here all is clearly made out with
strokes of the pencil, by fair, not by factitious means. Our author
takes a given subject from nature or from books, and then fills it up
with the ardent workings of his own mind, with the teeming and
audible pulses of his own heart. The effect is entire and satisfactory
in proportion. The work (so to speak) and the author are one.
We are not puzzled to decide upon their respective pretensions. In
reading Mr. Godwin’s novels, we know what share of merit the
author has in them. In reading the <cite>Scotch Novels</cite>, we are perpetually
embarrassed in asking ourselves this question; and perhaps it is not
altogether a false modesty that prevents the editor from putting his
name in the title-page—he is (for any thing we know to the contrary)
only a more voluminous sort of Allen-a-Dale. At least, we may
claim this advantage for the English author, that the chains with
which he rivets our attention are forged out of his own thoughts, link
by link, blow for blow, with glowing enthusiasm: we see the genuine
ore melted in the furnace of fervid feeling, and moulded into stately
and <em>ideal</em> forms; and this is so far better than peeping into an old
iron shop, or pilfering from a dealer in marine stores! There is one
drawback, however, attending this mode of proceeding, which attaches
generally, indeed, to all originality of composition; namely, that it
has a tendency to a certain degree of monotony. He who draws
upon his own resources, easily comes to an end of his wealth. Mr.
Godwin, in all his writings, dwells upon one idea or exclusive view
of a subject, aggrandises a sentiment, exaggerates a character, or
pushes an argument to extremes, and makes up by the force of style
and continuity of feeling for what he wants in variety of incident or
ease of manner. This necessary defect is observable in his best
works, and is still more so in Fleetwood and Mandeville; the one of
which, compared with his more admired performances, is mawkish,
and the other morbid. Mr. Godwin is also an essayist, an historian—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>short, what is he not, that belongs to the character of an indefatigable
and accomplished author? His <cite>Life of Chaucer</cite> would
have given celebrity to any man of letters possessed of three thousand
a year, with leisure to write quartos: as the legal acuteness displayed
in his <cite>Remarks on Judge Eyre’s Charge to the Jury</cite> would have raised
any briefless barrister to the height of his profession. This temporary
effusion did more—it gave a turn to the trials for high treason in the
year 1794, and possibly saved the lives of twelve innocent individuals,
marked out as political victims to the Moloch of Legitimacy, which
then skulked behind a British throne, and had not yet dared to stalk
forth (as it has done since) from its lurking-place, in the face of
day, to brave the opinion of the world. If it had then glutted its
maw with its intended prey (the sharpness of Mr. Godwin’s pen cut
the legal cords with which it was attempted to bind them), it might
have done so sooner, and with more lasting effect. The world do
not know (and we are not sure but the intelligence may startle Mr.
Godwin himself), that he is the author of a volume of Sermons, and
of a life of Chatham.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Fawcett (an old friend and fellow-student of our author, and
who always spoke of his writings with admiration, tinctured with
wonder) used to mention a circumstance with respect to the last-mentioned
work, which may throw some light on the history and
progress of Mr. Godwin’s mind. He was anxious to make his
biographical account as complete as he could, and applied for this
purpose to many of his acquaintance to furnish him with anecdotes or
to suggest criticisms. Amongst others Mr. Fawcett repeated to him
what he thought a striking passage in a speech on <cite>General Warrants</cite>
delivered by Lord Chatham, at which he (Mr. Fawcett) had been
present. ‘Every man’s house’ (said this emphatic thinker and
speaker) ‘has been called his castle. And why is it called his castle?
Is it because it is defended by a wall, because it is surrounded with
a moat? No, it may be nothing more than a straw-built shed. It
may be open to all the elements: the wind may enter in, the rain may
enter in—but the king <em>cannot</em> enter in!’ His friend thought that the
point was here palpable enough: but when he came to read the
printed volume, he found it thus <em>transposed</em>: ‘Every man’s house is
his castle. And why is it called so? Is it because it is defended by
a wall, because it is surrounded with a moat? No, it may be nothing
more than a straw-built shed. It may be exposed to all the elements:
the rain may enter into it, <em>all the winds of Heaven may whistle round
it</em>, but the king cannot, &amp;c.’ This was what Fawcett called a defect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of <em>natural imagination</em>. He at the same time admitted that Mr.
Godwin had improved his native sterility in this respect; or atoned
for it by incessant activity of mind and by accumulated stores of
thought and powers of language. In fact, his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is not the spontaneous,
but the voluntary exercise of talent. He fixes his ambition
on a high point of excellence, and spares no pains or time in attaining
it. He has less of the appearance of a man of genius, than any one
who has given such decided and ample proofs of it. He is ready only
on reflection: dangerous only at the rebound. He gathers himself
up, and strains every nerve and faculty with deliberate aim to some
heroic and dazzling achievement of intellect: but he must make a
career before he flings himself, armed, upon the enemy, or he is sure
to be unhorsed. Or he resembles an eight-day clock that must be
wound up long before it can strike. Therefore, his powers of
conversation are but limited. He has neither acuteness of remark,
nor a flow of language, both which might be expected from his
writings, as these are no less distinguished by a sustained and impassioned
tone of declamation than by novelty of opinion or brilliant
tracks of invention. In company, Horne Tooke used to make a
mere child of him—or of any man! Mr. Godwin liked this treatment,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
and indeed it is his foible to fawn on those who use him
<em>cavalierly</em>, and to be cavalier to those who express an undue or
unqualified admiration of him. He looks up with unfeigned respect
to acknowledged reputation (but then it must be very well ascertained
before he admits it)—and has a favourite hypothesis that Understanding
and Virtue are the same thing. Mr. Godwin possesses a high degree
of philosophical candour, and studiously paid the homage of his pen
and person to Mr. Malthus, Sir James Mackintosh, and Dr. Parr, for
their unsparing attacks on him; but woe to any poor devil who had
the hardihood to defend him against them! In private, the author of
<cite>Political Justice</cite> at one time reminded those who knew him of the
metaphysician engrafted on the Dissenting Minister. There was a
dictatorial, captious, quibbling pettiness of manner. He lost this with
the first blush and awkwardness of popularity, which surprised him
in the retirement of his study; and he has since, with the wear and
tear of society, from being too pragmatical, become somewhat too
careless. He is, at present, as easy as an old glove. Perhaps there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>is a little attention to effect in this, and he wishes to appear a foil to
himself. His best moments are with an intimate acquaintance or two,
when he gossips in a fine vein about old authors, Clarendon’s <cite>History
of the Rebellion</cite>, or Burnet’s <cite>History of his own Time</cite>; and you
perceive by your host’s talk, as by the taste of seasoned wine, that he
has a <em>cellarage</em> in his understanding! Mr. Godwin also has a correct
<em>acquired</em> taste in poetry and the drama. He relishes Donne and Ben
Jonson, and recites a passage from either with an agreeable mixture
of pedantry and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i>. He is not one of those who do not grow
wiser with opportunity and reflection: he changes his opinions, and
changes them for the better. The alteration of his taste in poetry,
from an exclusive admiration of the age of Queen Anne to an almost
equally exclusive one of that of Elizabeth, is, we suspect, owing to
Mr. Coleridge, who some twenty years ago, threw a great stone into
the standing pool of criticism, which splashed some persons with the
mud, but which gave a motion to the surface and a reverberation to
the neighbouring echoes, which has not since subsided. In common
company, Mr. Godwin either goes to sleep himself, or sets others to
sleep. He is at present engaged in a History of the Commonwealth
of England.—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Esto perpetua!</span></i> In size Mr. Godwin is below the
common stature, nor is his deportment graceful or animated. His
face is, however, fine, with an expression of placid temper and
recondite thought. He is not unlike the common portraits of Locke.
There is a very admirable likeness of him by Mr. Northcote, which
with a more heroic and dignified air, only does justice to the profound
sagacity and benevolent aspirations of our author’s mind. Mr. Godwin
has kept the best company of his time, but he has survived most of
the celebrated persons with whom he lived in habits of intimacy.
He speaks of them with enthusiasm and with discrimination; and
sometimes dwells with peculiar delight on a day passed at John
Kemble’s in company with Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Curran, Mrs.
Wollstonecraft and Mrs. Inchbald, when the conversation took a
most animated turn, and the subject was of Love. Of all these our
author is the only one remaining. Frail tenure, on which human life
and genius are lent us for a while to improve or to enjoy!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. COLERIDGE</h3>

<p class='c008'>The present is an age of talkers, and not of doers; and the reason
is, that the world is growing old. We are so far advanced in the
Arts and Sciences, that we live in retrospect, and doat on past
achievements. The accumulation of knowledge has been so great,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>that we are lost in wonder at the height it has reached, instead of
attempting to climb or add to it; while the variety of objects distracts
and dazzles the looker-on. What <em>niche</em> remains unoccupied? What
path untried? What is the use of doing anything, unless we could do
better than all those who have gone before us? What hope is there
of this? We are like those who have been to see some noble
monument of art, who are content to admire without thinking of
rivalling it; or like guests after a feast, who praise the hospitality of
the donor ‘and thank the bounteous Pan’—perhaps carrying away
some trifling fragments; or like the spectators of a mighty battle, who
still hear its sound afar off, and the clashing of armour and the
neighing of the war-horse and the shout of victory is in their ears,
like the rushing of innumerable waters!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Coleridge has ‘a mind reflecting ages past’; his voice is like
the echo of the congregated roar of the ‘dark rearward and abyss’
of thought. He who has seen a mouldering tower by the side of a
chrystal lake, hid by the mist, but glittering in the wave below, may
conceive the dim, gleaming, uncertain intelligence of his eye: he who
has marked the evening clouds uprolled (a world of vapours), has
seen the picture of his mind, unearthly, unsubstantial, with gorgeous
tints and ever-varying forms—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That which was now a horse, even with a thought</div>
      <div class='line'>The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct</div>
      <div class='line'>As water is in water.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Our author’s mind is (as he himself might express it) <em>tangential</em>.
There is no subject on which he has not touched, none on which he
has rested. With an understanding fertile, subtle, expansive, ‘quick,
forgetive, apprehensive,’ beyond all living precedent, few traces of it
will perhaps remain. He lends himself to all impressions alike; he
gives up his mind and liberty of thought to none. He is a general
lover of art and science, and wedded to no one in particular. He
pursues knowledge as a mistress, with outstretched hands and winged
speed; but as he is about to embrace her, his Daphne turns—alas!
not to a laurel! Hardly a speculation has been left on record from
the earliest time, but it is loosely folded up in Mr. Coleridge’s
memory, like a rich, but somewhat tattered piece of tapestry: we
might add (with more seeming than real extravagance), that scarce a
thought can pass through the mind of man, but its sound has at some
time or other passed over his head with rustling pinions. On whatever
question or author you speak, he is prepared to take up the theme
with advantage—from Peter Abelard down to Thomas Moore, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the subtlest metaphysics to the politics of the <cite>Courier</cite>. There is no
man of genius, in whose praise he descants, but the critic seems to
stand above the author, and ‘what in him is weak, to strengthen,
what is low, to raise and support’: nor is there any work of genius
that does not come out of his hands like an illuminated Missal,
sparkling even in its defects. If Mr. Coleridge had not been the
most impressive talker of his age, he would probably have been the
finest writer; but he lays down his pen to make sure of an auditor,
and mortgages the admiration of posterity for the stare of an idler.
If he had not been a poet, he would have been a powerful logician;
if he had not dipped his wing in the Unitarian controversy, he might
have soared to the very summit of fancy. But in writing verse, he is
trying to subject the Muse to <em>transcendental</em> theories: in his abstract
reasoning, he misses his way by strewing it with flowers. All that
he has done of moment, he had done twenty years ago: since then,
he may be said to have lived on the sound of his own voice. Mr.
Coleridge is too rich in intellectual wealth, to need to task himself to
any drudgery: he has only to draw the sliders of his imagination, and
a thousand subjects expand before him, startling him with their
brilliancy, or losing themselves in endless obscurity—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And by the force of blear illusion,</div>
      <div class='line'>They draw him on to his confusion.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>What is the little he could add to the stock, compared with the
countless stores that lie about him, that he should stoop to pick up a
name, or to polish an idle fancy? He walks abroad in the majesty
of an universal understanding, eyeing the ‘rich strond,’ or golden sky
above him, and ‘goes sounding on his way,’ in eloquent accents,
uncompelled and free!</p>

<p class='c011'>Persons of the greatest capacity are often those, who for this reason
do the least; for surveying themselves from the highest point of
view, amidst the infinite variety of the universe, their own share in it
seems trifling, and scarce worth a thought, and they prefer the contemplation
of all that is, or has been, or can be, to the making a coil
about doing what, when done, is no better than vanity. It is hard to
concentrate all our attention and efforts on one pursuit, except from
ignorance of others; and without this concentration of our faculties,
no great progress can be made in any one thing. It is not merely
that the mind is not capable of the effort; it does not think the effort
worth making. Action is one; but thought is manifold. He whose
restless eye glances through the wide compass of nature and art, will
not consent to have ‘his own nothings monstered’: but he must do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>this, before he can give his whole soul to them. The mind, after
‘letting contemplation have its fill,’ or</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sailing with supreme dominion</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the azure deep of air,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>sinks down on the ground, breathless, exhausted, powerless, inactive;
or if it must have some vent to its feelings, seeks the most
easy and obvious; is soothed by friendly flattery, lulled by the
murmur of immediate applause, thinks as it were aloud, and babbles
in its dreams! A scholar (so to speak) is a more disinterested and
abstracted character than a mere author. The first looks at the
numberless volumes of a library, and says, ‘All these are mine’:
the other points to a single volume (perhaps it may be an immortal
one) and says, ‘My name is written on the back of it.’ This is a
puny and groveling ambition, beneath the lofty amplitude of Mr.
Coleridge’s mind. No, he revolves in his wayward soul, or utters to
the passing wind, or discourses to his own shadow, things mightier
and more various!—Let us draw the curtain, and unlock the
shrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Learning rocked him in his cradle, and while yet a child,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘He lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>At sixteen he wrote his <cite>Ode on Chatterton</cite>, and he still reverts to that
period with delight, not so much as it relates to himself (for that
string of his own early promise of fame rather jars than otherwise)
but as exemplifying the youth of a poet. Mr. Coleridge talks of
himself, without being an egotist, for in him the individual is always
merged in the abstract and general. He distinguished himself at
school and at the University by his knowledge of the classics, and
gained several prizes for Greek epigrams. How many men are
there (great scholars, celebrated names in literature) who having
done the same thing in their youth, have no other idea all the rest
of their lives but of this achievement, of a fellowship and dinner, and
who, installed in academic honours, would look down on our author
as a mere strolling bard! At Christ’s Hospital, where he was
brought up, he was the idol of those among his schoolfellows, who
mingled with their bookish studies the music of thought and of
humanity; and he was usually attended round the cloisters by a
group of these (inspiring and inspired) whose hearts, even then,
burnt within them as he talked, and where the sounds yet linger to
mock <span class='sc'>Elia</span> on his way, still turning pensive to the past! One of the
finest and rarest parts of Mr. Coleridge’s conversation, is when he
expatiates on the Greek tragedians (not that he is not well acquainted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>when he pleases, with the epic poets, or the philosophers, or orators,
or historians of antiquity)—on the subtle reasonings and melting
pathos of Euripides, on the harmonious gracefulness of Sophocles,
tuning his love-laboured song, like sweetest warblings from a sacred
grove; on the high-wrought trumpet-tongued eloquence of Æschylus,
whose Prometheus, above all, is like an Ode to Fate, and a pleading
with Providence, his thoughts being let loose as his body is
chained on his solitary rock, and his afflicted will (the emblem of
mortality)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>As the impassioned critic speaks and rises in his theme, you would
think you heard the voice of the Man hated by the Gods, contending
with the wild winds as they roar, and his eye glitters with the
spirit of Antiquity!</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, he was engaged with Hartley’s tribes of mind, ‘etherial
braid, thought-woven,’—and he busied himself for a year or two with
vibrations and vibratiuncles and the great law of association that binds
all things in its mystic chain, and the doctrine of Necessity (the mild
teacher of Charity) and the Millennium, anticipative of a life to come—and
he plunged deep into the controversy on Matter and Spirit,
and, as an escape from Dr. Priestley’s Materialism, where he felt
himself imprisoned by the logician’s spell, like Ariel in the cloven
pine-tree, he became suddenly enamoured of Bishop Berkeley’s fairy-world,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
and used in all companies to build the universe, like a brave
poetical fiction, of fine words—and he was deep-read in Malebranche,
and in Cudworth’s Intellectual System (a huge pile of learning,
unwieldy, enormous) and in Lord Brook’s hieroglyphic theories, and
in Bishop Butler’s Sermons, and in the Duchess of Newcastle’s
fantastic folios, and in Clarke and South and Tillotson, and all the
fine thinkers and masculine reasoners of that age—and Leibnitz’s
<cite>Pre-Established Harmony</cite> reared its arch above his head, like the
rainbow in the cloud, covenanting with the hopes of man—and then
he fell plump, ten thousand fathoms down (but his wings saved him
harmless) into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hortus siccus</span></i> of Dissent, where he pared religion
down to the standard of reason, and stripped faith of mystery, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>preached Christ crucified and the Unity of the Godhead, and so
dwelt for a while in the spirit with John Huss and Jerome of
Prague and Socinus and old John Zisca, and ran through Neal’s
History of the Puritans, and Calamy’s Non-Conformists’ Memorial,
having like thoughts and passions with them—but then Spinoza
became his God, and he took up the vast chain of being in his hand,
and the round world became the centre and the soul of all things in
some shadowy sense, forlorn of meaning, and around him he beheld
the living traces and the sky-pointing proportions of the mighty Pan—but
poetry redeemed him from this spectral philosophy, and
he bathed his heart in beauty, and gazed at the golden light of
heaven, and drank of the spirit of the universe, and wandered at eve
by fairy-stream or fountain,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘——When he saw nought but beauty,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he heard the voice of that Almighty One</div>
      <div class='line'>In every breeze that blew, or wave that murmured’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and wedded with truth in Plato’s shade, and in the writings of
Proclus and Plotinus saw the ideas of things in the eternal mind,
and unfolded all mysteries with the Schoolmen and fathomed the
depths of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas, and entered the third
heaven with Jacob Behmen, and walked hand in hand with Swedenborg
through the pavilions of the New Jerusalem, and sung his faith
in the promise and in the word in his <cite>Religious Musings</cite>—and
lowering himself from that dizzy height, poised himself on Milton’s
wings, and spread out his thoughts in charity with the glad prose of
Jeremy Taylor, and wept over Bowles’s Sonnets, and studied
Cowper’s blank verse, and betook himself to Thomson’s Castle of
Indolence, and sported with the wits of Charles the Second’s days
and of Queen Anne, and relished Swift’s style and that of the John
Bull (Arbuthnot’s we mean, not Mr. Croker’s), and dallied with
the British Essayists and Novelists, and knew all qualities of more
modern writers with a learned spirit, Johnson, and Goldsmith, and
Junius, and Burke, and Godwin, and the Sorrows of Werter, and
Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire, and Marivaux, and Crebillon,
and thousands more—now ‘laughed with Rabelais in his easy chair’
or pointed to Hogarth, or afterwards dwelt on Claude’s classic
scenes, or spoke with rapture of Raphael, and compared the women
at Rome to figures that had walked out of his pictures, or visited the
Oratory of Pisa, and described the works of Giotto and Ghirlandaio
and Massaccio, and gave the moral of the picture of the Triumph of
Death, where the beggars and the wretched invoke his dreadful dart,
but the rich and mighty of the earth quail and shrink before it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and in that land of siren sights and sounds, saw a dance of peasant
girls, and was charmed with lutes and gondolas,—or wandered into
Germany and lost himself in the labyrinths of the Hartz Forest
and of the Kantean philosophy, and amongst the cabalistic names of
Fichté and Schelling and Lessing, and God knows who—this was
long after, but all the former while, he had nerved his heart and filled
his eyes with tears, as he hailed the rising orb of liberty, since
quenched in darkness and in blood, and had kindled his affections at
the blaze of the French Revolution, and sang for joy when the
towers of the Bastile and the proud places of the insolent and the
oppressor fell, and would have floated his bark, freighted with
fondest fancies, across the Atlantic wave with Southey and others to
seek for peace and freedom—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In Philarmonia’s undivided dale!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Alas! ‘Frailty, thy name is <em>Genius</em>!’—What is become of all
this mighty heap of hope, of thought, of learning, and humanity?
It has ended in swallowing doses of oblivion and in writing
paragraphs in the <cite>Courier</cite>.—Such and so little is the mind of man!</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not to be supposed that Mr. Coleridge could keep on at
the rate he set off; he could not realize all he knew or thought, and
less could not fix his desultory ambition; other stimulants supplied
the place, and kept up the intoxicating dream, the fever and the
madness of his early impressions. Liberty (the philosopher’s and
the poet’s bride) had fallen a victim, meanwhile, to the murderous
practices of the hag, Legitimacy. Proscribed by court-hirelings, too
romantic for the herd of vulgar politicians, our enthusiast stood at
bay, and at last turned on the pivot of a subtle casuistry to the <em>unclean
side</em>: but his discursive reason would not let him trammel himself
into a poet-laureate or stamp-distributor, and he stopped, ere he had
quite passed that well-known ‘bourne from whence no traveller
returns’—and so has sunk into torpid, uneasy repose, tantalized by
useless resources, haunted by vain imaginings, his lips idly moving, but
his heart for ever still, or, as the shattered chords vibrate of themselves,
making melancholy music to the ear of memory! Such is
the fate of genius in an age, when in the unequal contest with
sovereign wrong, every man is ground to powder who is not either a
born slave, or who does not willingly and at once offer up the
yearnings of humanity and the dictates of reason as a welcome
sacrifice to besotted prejudice and loathsome power.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of all Mr. Coleridge’s productions, the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite> is the
only one that we could with confidence put into any person’s hands,
on whom we wished to impress a favourable idea of his extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>powers. Let whatever other objections be made to it, it is unquestionably
a work of genius—of wild, irregular, overwhelming imagination,
and has that rich, varied movement in the verse, which gives a
distant idea of the lofty or changeful tones of Mr. Coleridge’s voice.
In the <cite>Christabel</cite>, there is one splendid passage on divided friendship.
The <cite>Translation of Schiller’s Wallenstein</cite> is also a masterly production
in its kind, faithful and spirited. Among his smaller pieces there are
occasional bursts of pathos and fancy, equal to what we might expect
from him; but these form the exception, and not the rule. Such,
for instance, is his affecting Sonnet to the author of the Robbers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Schiller! that hour I would have wish’d to die,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If through the shudd’ring midnight I had sent</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From the dark dungeon of the tower time-rent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fearful voice, a famish’d father’s cry—</div>
      <div class='line'>That in no after-moment aught less vast</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Might stamp me mortal! A triumphant shout</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Black horror scream’d, and all her goblin rout</div>

      <div class='line'>Ah! Bard tremendous in sublimity!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Could I behold thee in thy loftier mood,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Beneath some vast old tempest-swinging wood!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Awhile, with mute awe gazing, I would brood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then weep aloud in a wild ecstasy.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>His Tragedy, entitled <cite>Remorse</cite>, is full of beautiful and striking
passages, but it does not place the author in the first rank of dramatic
writers. But if Mr. Coleridge’s works do not place him in that rank,
they injure instead of conveying a just idea of the man, for he himself
is certainly in the first class of general intellect.</p>

<p class='c011'>If our author’s poetry is inferior to his conversation, his prose is
utterly abortive. Hardly a gleam is to be found in it of the brilliancy
and richness of those stores of thought and language that he pours out
incessantly, when they are lost like drops of water in the ground.
The principal work, in which he has attempted to embody his general
views of things, is the <span class='sc'>Friend</span>, of which, though it contains some
noble passages and fine trains of thought, prolixity and obscurity are
the most frequent characteristics.</p>

<p class='c011'>No two persons can be conceived more opposite in character or
genius than the subject of the present and of the preceding sketch.
Mr. Godwin, with less natural capacity, and with fewer acquired
advantages, by concentrating his mind on some given object, and
doing what he had to do with all his might, has accomplished much,
and will leave more than one monument of a powerful intellect behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>him; Mr. Coleridge, by dissipating his, and dallying with every
subject by turns, has done little or nothing to justify to the world or
to posterity, the high opinion which all who have ever heard him
converse, or known him intimately, with one accord entertain of him.
Mr. Godwin’s faculties have kept at home, and plied their task in the
workshop of the brain, diligently and effectually: Mr. Coleridge’s
have gossiped away their time, and gadded about from house to
house, as if life’s business were to melt the hours in listless talk.
Mr. Godwin is intent on a subject, only as it concerns himself and
his reputation; he works it out as a matter of duty, and discards
from his mind whatever does not forward his main object as impertinent
and vain. Mr. Coleridge, on the other hand, delights in nothing but
episodes and digressions, neglects whatever he undertakes to perform,
and can act only on spontaneous impulses, without object or method.
‘He cannot be constrained by mastery.’ While he should be
occupied with a given pursuit, he is thinking of a thousand other
things; a thousand tastes, a thousand objects tempt him, and distract
his mind, which keeps open house, and entertains all comers; and
after being fatigued and amused with morning calls from idle visitors,
finds the day consumed and its business unconcluded. Mr. Godwin,
on the contrary, is somewhat exclusive and unsocial in his habits of
mind, entertains no company but what he gives his whole time and
attention to, and wisely writes over the doors of his understanding,
his fancy, and his senses—‘No admittance except on business.’ He
has none of that fastidious refinement and false delicacy, which might
lead him to balance between the endless variety of modern attainments.
He does not throw away his life (nor a single half-hour of
it) in adjusting the claims of different accomplishments, and in choosing
between them or making himself master of them all. He sets
about his task, (whatever it may be) and goes through it with spirit
and fortitude. He has the happiness to think an author the greatest
character in the world, and himself the greatest author in it. Mr.
Coleridge, in writing an harmonious stanza, would stop to consider
whether there was not more grace and beauty in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas de trois</span></i>, and
would not proceed till he had resolved this question by a chain of
metaphysical reasoning without end. Not so Mr. Godwin. That is
best to him, which he can do best. He does not waste himself in
vain aspirations and effeminate sympathies. He is blind, deaf,
insensible to all but the trump of Fame. Plays, operas, painting,
music, ball-rooms, wealth, fashion, titles, lords, ladies, touch him not—all
these are no more to him than to the magician in his cell, and
he writes on to the end of the chapter, through good report and evil
report. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pingo in eternitatem</span></i>—is his motto. He neither envies nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>admires what others are, but is contented to be what he is, and strives
to do the utmost he can. Mr. Coleridge has flirted with the Muses
as with a set of mistresses: Mr. Godwin has been married twice, to
Reason and to Fancy, and has to boast no short-lived progeny by
each. So to speak, he has <em>valves</em> belonging to his mind, to regulate
the quantity of gas admitted into it, so that like the bare, unsightly,
but well-compacted steam-vessel, it cuts its liquid way, and arrives at
its promised end: while Mr. Coleridge’s bark, ‘taught with the little
nautilus to sail,’ the sport of every breath, dancing to every wave,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>flutters its gaudy pennons in the air, glitters in the sun, but we wait
in vain to hear of its arrival in the destined harbour. Mr. Godwin,
with less variety and vividness, with less subtlety and susceptibility
both of thought and feeling, has had firmer nerves, a more determined
purpose, a more comprehensive grasp of his subject, and the results
are as we find them. Each has met with his reward: for justice has,
after all, been done to the pretensions of each; and we must, in all
cases, use means to ends!</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a misfortune to any man of talent to be born in the latter
end of the last century. Genius stopped the way of Legitimacy, and
therefore it was to be abated, crushed, or set aside as a nuisance.
The spirit of the monarchy was at variance with the spirit of the age.
The flame of liberty, the light of intellect, was to be extinguished
with the sword—or with slander, whose edge is sharper than the
sword. The war between power and reason was carried on by the
first of these abroad—by the last at home. No quarter was given
(then or now) by the Government-critics, the authorised censors of
the press, to those who followed the dictates of independence, who
listened to the voice of the tempter, Fancy. Instead of gathering
fruits and flowers, immortal fruits and amaranthine flowers, they soon
found themselves beset not only by a host of prejudices, but assailed
with all the engines of power, by nicknames, by lies, by all the arts
of malice, interest and hypocrisy, without the possibility of their
defending themselves ‘from the pelting of the pitiless storm,’ that
poured down upon them from the strong-holds of corruption and
authority. The philosophers, the dry abstract reasoners, submitted
to this reverse pretty well, and armed themselves with patience ‘as
with triple steel,’ to bear discomfiture, persecution, and disgrace.
But the poets, the creatures of sympathy, could not stand the frowns
both of king and people. They did not like to be shut out when
places and pensions, when the critic’s praises, and the laurel-wreath
were about to be distributed. They did not stomach being <em>sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Coventry</em>, and Mr. Coleridge sounded a retreat for them by the help
of casuistry, and a musical voice.—‘His words were hollow, but
they pleased the ear’ of his friends of the Lake School, who turned
back disgusted and panic-struck from the dry desert of unpopularity,
like Hassan the camel-driver,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And curs’d the hour, and curs’d the luckless day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When first from Shiraz’ walls they bent their way.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>They are safely inclosed there, but Mr. Coleridge did not enter
with them; pitching his tent upon the barren waste without, and
having no abiding place nor city of refuge!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>REV. MR. IRVING</h3>

<p class='c008'>This gentleman has gained an almost unprecedented, and not an
altogether unmerited popularity as a preacher. As he is, perhaps,
though a burning and a shining light, not ‘one of the fixed,’ we shall
take this opportunity of discussing his merits, while he is at his
meridian height; and in doing so, shall ‘nothing extenuate, nor set
down aught in malice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Few circumstances show the prevailing and preposterous rage for
novelty in a more striking point of view, than the success of Mr.
Irving’s oratory. People go to hear him in crowds, and come away
with a mixture of delight and astonishment—they go again to see if
the effect will continue, and send others to try to find out the
mystery—and in the noisy conflict between extravagant encomiums
and splenetic objections, the true secret escapes observation, which is,
that the whole thing is, nearly from beginning to end, a <em>transposition
of ideas</em>. If the subject of these remarks had come out as a player,
with all his advantages of figure, voice, and action, we think he
would have failed; if, as a preacher, he had kept within the strict
bounds of pulpit-oratory, he would scarcely have been much distinguished
among his Calvinistic brethren: as a mere author, he
would have excited attention rather by his quaintness and affectation
of an obsolete style and mode of thinking, than by any thing else.
But he has contrived to jumble these several characters together in an
unheard-of and unwarranted manner, and the fascination is altogether
irresistible. Our Caledonian divine is equally an anomaly in religion,
in literature, in personal appearance, and in public speaking. To
hear a person spout Shakspeare on the stage is nothing—the charm is
nearly worn out—but to hear any one spout Shakspeare (and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>not in a sneaking under-tone, but at the top of his voice, and with
the full breadth of his chest) from a Calvinistic pulpit, is new
and wonderful. The <em>Fancy</em> have lately lost something of their gloss
in public estimation, and after the last fight, few would go far
to see a Neat or a Spring set-to;—but to see a man who is able
to enter the ring with either of them, or brandish a quarter-staff
with Friar Tuck, or a broad-sword with Shaw the Life-guard’s
man, stand up in a strait-laced old-fashioned pulpit, and bandy
dialectics with modern philosophers, or give a <em>cross-buttock</em> to a
cabinet minister, there is something in a sight like this also, that is a
cure for sore eyes. It is as if Crib or Molyneux had turned
Methodist parson, or as if a Patagonian savage were to come
forward as the patron-saint of Evangelical religion. Again, the
doctrine of eternal punishment was one of the staple arguments with
which, everlastingly drawled out, the old school of Presbyterian
divines used to keep their audiences awake, or lull them to sleep;
but to which people of taste and fashion paid little attention, as
inelegant and barbarous, till Mr. Irving, with his cast-iron features
and sledge-hammer blows, puffing like a grim Vulcan, set to work
to forge more classic thunderbolts, and kindle the expiring flames
anew with the very sweepings of sceptical and infidel libraries, so
as to excite a pleasing horror in the female part of his congregation.
In short, our popular declaimer has, contrary to the Scripture-caution,
put new wine into old bottles, or new cloth on old garments. He
has, with an unlimited and daring licence, mixed the sacred and the
profane together, the carnal and the spiritual man, the petulance of
the bar with the dogmatism of the pulpit, the theatrical and theological,
the modern and the obsolete;—what wonder that this
splendid piece of patchwork, splendid by contradiction and contrast,
has delighted some and confounded others? The more serious part
of his congregation indeed complain, though not bitterly, that their
pastor has converted their meeting-house into a play-house: but when
a lady of quality, introducing herself and her three daughters to the
preacher, assures him that they have been to all the most fashionable
places of resort, the opera, the theatre, assemblies, Miss Macauley’s
readings, and Exeter-Change, and have been equally entertained no
where else, we apprehend that no remonstrances of a committee of
ruling-elders will be able to bring him to his senses again, or make
him forego such sweet, but ill-assorted praise. What we mean to
insist upon is, that Mr. Irving owes his triumphant success, not to
any one quality for which he has been extolled, but to a combination
of qualities, the more striking in their immediate effect, in proportion
as they are unlooked-for and heterogeneous, like the violent opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of light and shade in a picture. We shall endeavour to explain this
view of the subject more at large.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Irving, then, is no common or mean man. He has four or
five qualities, possessed in a moderate or in a paramount degree,
which, added or multiplied together, fill up the important space he
occupies in the public eye. Mr. Irving’s intellect itself is of a
superior order; he has undoubtedly both talents and acquirements
beyond the ordinary run of every-day preachers. These alone,
however, we hold, would not account for a twentieth part of the
effect he has produced: they would have lifted him perhaps out of
the mire and slough of sordid obscurity, but would never have
launched him into the ocean-stream of popularity, in which he ‘lies
floating many a rood’;—but to these he adds uncommon height,
a graceful figure and action, a clear and powerful voice, a striking,
if not a fine face, a bold and fiery spirit, and a most portentous
obliquity of vision, which throw him to an immeasurable distance
beyond all competition, and effectually relieve whatever there might
be of common-place or bombast in his style of composition. Put
the case that Mr. Irving had been five feet high—Would he ever
have been heard of, or, as he does now, have ‘bestrode the world
like a Colossus?’ No, the thing speaks for itself. He would in
vain have lifted his Lilliputian arm to Heaven, people would have
laughed at his monkey-tricks. Again, had he been as tall as he
is, but had wanted other recommendations, he would have been
nothing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Conceive a rough, ugly, shock-headed Scotchman, standing up in the
Caledonian Chapel, and dealing ‘damnation round the land’ in a
broad northern dialect, and with a harsh, screaking voice, what ear
polite, what smile serene would have hailed the barbarous prodigy,
or not consigned him to utter neglect and derision? But the Rev.
Edward Irving, with all his native wildness, ‘hath a smooth aspect
framed to make women’ saints; his very unusual size and height are
carried off and moulded into elegance by the most admirable symmetry
of form and ease of gesture; his sable locks, his clear iron-grey
complexion, and firm-set features, turn the raw, uncouth Scotchman
into the likeness of a noble Italian picture; and even his distortion
of sight only redeems the otherwise ‘faultless monster’ within the
bounds of humanity, and, when admiration is exhausted and curiosity
ceases, excites a new interest by leading to the idle question whether
it is an advantage to the preacher or not. Farther, give him all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>actual and remarkable advantages of body and mind, let him be as
tall, as strait, as dark and clear of skin, as much at his ease, as silver-tongued,
as eloquent and as argumentative as he is, yet with all
these, and without a little charlatanry to set them off he had been
nothing. He might, keeping within the rigid line of his duty and
professed calling, have preached on for ever; he might have divided
the old-fashioned doctrines of election, grace, reprobation, predestination,
into his sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth heads, and his
<em>lastly</em> have been looked for as a ‘consummation devoutly to be
wished’; he might have defied the devil and all his works, and by
the help of a loud voice and strong-set person—</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>have increased his own congregation, and been quoted among the
godly as a powerful preacher of the word; but in addition to this,
he went out of his way to attack Jeremy Bentham, and the town
was up in arms. The thing was new. He thus wiped the stain of
musty ignorance and formal bigotry out of his style. Mr. Irving
must have something superior in him, to look over the shining close-packed
heads of his congregation to have a hit at the <cite>Great Jurisconsult</cite>
in his study. He next, ere the report of the former blow had
subsided, made a lunge at Mr. Brougham, and glanced an eye at
Mr. Canning; <em>mystified</em> Mr. Coleridge, and <em>stultified</em> Lord Liverpool
in his place—in the Gallery. It was rare sport to see him, ‘like an
eagle in a dovecote, flutter the Volscians in Corioli.’ He has found
out the secret of attracting by repelling. Those whom he is likely
to attack are curious to hear what he says of them: they go again,
to show that they do not mind it. It is no less interesting to the
bystanders, who like to witness this sort of <em>onslaught</em>—like a charge
of cavalry, the shock, and the resistance. Mr. Irving has, in fact,
without leave asked or a licence granted, converted the Caledonian
Chapel into a Westminster Forum or Debating Society, with the
sanctity of religion added to it. Our spirited polemic is not
contented to defend the citadel of orthodoxy against all impugners,
and shut himself up in texts of Scripture and huge volumes of the
Commentators as an impregnable fortress;—he merely makes use of
the stronghold of religion as a resting-place, from which he sallies
forth, armed with modern topics and with penal fire, like Achilles
of old rushing from the Grecian tents, against the adversaries of God
and man. Peter Aretine is said to have laid the Princes of Europe
under contribution by penning satires against them: so Mr. Irving
keeps the public in awe by insulting all their favourite idols. He
does not spare their politicians, their rulers, their moralists, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>poets, their players, their critics, their reviewers, their magazine-writers;
he levels their resorts of business, their places of amusement,
at a blow—their cities, churches, palaces, ranks and professions,
refinements, and elegances—and leaves nothing standing but himself,
a mighty landmark in a degenerate age, overlooking the wide havoc
he has made! He makes war upon all arts and sciences, upon the
faculties and nature of man, on his vices and his virtues, on all
existing institutions, and all possible improvements, that nothing may
be left but the Kirk of Scotland, and that he may be the head of it.
He literally sends a challenge to all London in the name of the
<span class='sc'>King</span> of <span class='sc'>Heaven</span>, to evacuate its streets, to disperse its population,
to lay aside its employments, to burn its wealth, to renounce its
vanities and pomp; and for what?—that he may enter in as the
<em>King of Glory</em>; or after enforcing his threat with the battering-ram
of logic, the grape-shot of rhetoric, and the cross-fire of his double
vision, reduce the British metropolis to a Scottish heath, with a few
miserable hovels upon it, where they may worship God according to
<em>the root of the matter</em>, and where an old man with a blue bonnet, a
fair-haired girl, and a little child would form the flower of his flock!
Such is the pretension and the boast of this new Peter the Hermit,
who would get rid of all we have done in the way of improvement
on a state of barbarous ignorance, or still more barbarous prejudice,
in order to begin again on a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i> of Calvinism, and have a
world of his own making. It is not very surprising that when
nearly the whole mass and texture of civil society is indicted as a
nuisance, and threatened to be pulled down as a rotten building ready
to fall on the heads of the inhabitants, that all classes of people run
to hear the crash, and to see the engines and levers at work which
are to effect this laudable purpose. What else can be the meaning
of our preacher’s taking upon himself to denounce the sentiments of
the most serious professors in great cities, as vitiated and stark-naught,
of relegating religion to his native glens, and pretending that the
hymn of praise or the sigh of contrition cannot ascend acceptably
to the throne of grace from the crowded street as well as from the
barren rock or silent valley? Why put this affront upon his hearers?
Why belie his own aspirations?</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘God made the country, and man made the town.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>So says the poet; does Mr. Irving say so? If he does, and finds
the air of the city death to his piety, why does he not return home
again? But if he can breathe it with impunity, and still retain the
fervour of his early enthusiasm, and the simplicity and purity of the
faith that was once delivered to the saints, why not extend the benefit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of his own experience to others, instead of taunting them with a vapid
pastoral theory? Or, if our popular and eloquent divine finds a
change in himself, that flattery prevents the growth of grace, that he
is becoming the God of his own idolatry by being that of others,
that the glittering of coronet-coaches rolling down Holborn-Hill to
Hatton Garden, that titled beauty, that the parliamentary complexion
of his audience, the compliments of poets, and the stare of peers
discompose his wandering thoughts a little; and yet that he cannot
give up these strong temptations tugging at his heart; why not
extend more charity to others, and show more candour in speaking
of himself? There is either a good deal of bigoted intolerance with
a deplorable want of self-knowledge in all this; or at least an equal
degree of cant and quackery.</p>

<p class='c011'>To which ever cause we are to attribute this hyperbolical tone,
we hold it certain he could not have adopted it, if he had been <em>a little
man</em>. But his imposing figure and dignified manner enable him to
hazard sentiments or assertions that would be fatal to others. His
controversial daring is <em>backed</em> by his bodily prowess; and by bringing
his intellectual pretensions boldly into a line with his physical
accomplishments, he, indeed, presents a very formidable front to the
sceptic or the scoffer. Take a cubit from his stature, and his whole
manner resolves itself into an impertinence. But with that addition,
he <em>overcrows</em> the town, browbeats their prejudices, and bullies them
out of their senses, and is not afraid of being contradicted by any
one <em>less than himself</em>. It may be said, that individuals with great
personal defects have made a considerable figure as public speakers;
and Mr. Wilberforce, among others, may be held out as an instance.
Nothing can be more insignificant as to mere outward appearance,
and yet he is listened to in the House of Commons. But he does
not wield it, he does not insult or bully it. He leads by following
opinion, he trims, he shifts, he glides on the silvery sounds of his
undulating, flexible, cautiously modulated voice, winding his way
betwixt heaven and earth, now courting popularity, now calling
servility to his aid, and with a large estate, the ‘saints,’ and the
population of Yorkshire to swell his influence, never venturing on
the forlorn hope, or doing any thing more than ‘hitting the house
between wind and water.’ Yet he is probably a cleverer man than
Mr. Irving.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a Mr. Fox, a Dissenting Minister, as fluent a speaker,
with a sweeter voice and a more animated and beneficent countenance
than Mr. Irving, who expresses himself with manly spirit at a public
meeting, takes a hand at whist, and is the darling of his congregation;
but he is no more, because he is diminutive in person. His head is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>not seen above the crowd the length of a street off. He is the
Duke of Sussex in miniature, but the Duke of Sussex does not go
to hear him preach, as he attends Mr. Irving, who rises up against
him like a martello tower, and is nothing loth to confront the spirit
of a man of genius with the blood-royal. We allow there are, or
may be, talents sufficient to produce this equality without a single
personal advantage; but we deny that this would be the effect of any
that our great preacher possesses. We conceive it not improbable
that the consciousness of muscular power, that the admiration of his
person by strangers might first have inspired Mr. Irving with an
ambition to be something, intellectually speaking, and have given
him confidence to attempt the greatest things. He has not failed
for want of courage. The public, as well as the fair, are won by
a show of gallantry. Mr. Irving has shrunk from no opinion, however
paradoxical. He has scrupled to avow no sentiment, however
obnoxious. He has revived exploded prejudices, he has scouted
prevailing fashions. He has opposed the spirit of the age, and not
consulted the <em>esprit de corps</em>. He has brought back the doctrines of
Calvinism in all their inveteracy, and relaxed the inveteracy of his
northern accents. He has turned religion and the Caledonian
Chapel topsy-turvy. He has held a play-book in one hand, and a
Bible in the other, and quoted Shakespeare and Melancthon in the
same breath. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is no
longer, with his grafting, a dry withered stump; it shoots its branches
to the skies, and hangs out its blossoms to the gale—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He has taken the thorns and briars of scholastic divinity, and
garlanded them with the flowers of modern literature. He has
done all this, relying on the strength of a remarkably fine person and
manner, and through that he has succeeded—otherwise he would
have perished miserably.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Chalmers is not by any means so good a looking man, nor so
accomplished a speaker as Mr. Irving; yet he at one time almost
equalled his oratorical celebrity, and certainly paved the way for him.
He has therefore more merit than his admired pupil, as he has done
as much with fewer means. He has more scope of intellect and
more intensity of purpose. Both his matter and his manner, setting
aside his face and figure, are more impressive. Take the volume of
‘Sermons on Astronomy,’ by Dr. Chalmers, and the ‘Four Orations
for the Oracles of God’ which Mr. Irving lately published, and we
apprehend there can be no comparison as to their success. The
first ran like wild-fire through the country, were the darlings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>watering-places, were laid in the windows of inns,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and were to be
met with in all places of public resort; while the ‘Orations’ get on
but slowly, on Milton’s stilts, and are pompously announced as in a
Third Edition. We believe the fairest and fondest of his admirers
would rather see and hear Mr. Irving than read him. The reason
is, that the ground work of his compositions is trashy and hackneyed,
though set off by extravagant metaphors and an affected phraseology;
that without the turn of his head and wave of his hand, his periods
have nothing in them; and that he himself is the only <em>idea</em> with
which he has yet enriched the public mind! He must play off his
person, as Orator Henley used to dazzle his hearers with his diamond-ring.
The small frontispiece prefixed to the ‘Orations’ does not
serve to convey an adequate idea of the magnitude of the man, nor
of the ease and freedom of his motions in the pulpit. How different
is Dr. Chalmers! He is like ‘a monkey-preacher’ to the other.
He cannot boast of personal appearance to set him off. But then
he is like the very genius or demon of theological controversy
personified. He has neither airs nor graces at command; he thinks
nothing of himself: he has nothing theatrical about him (which
cannot be said of his successor and rival); but you see a man in
mortal throes and agony with doubts and difficulties, seizing stubborn
knotty points with his teeth, tearing them with his hands, and straining
his eyeballs till they almost start out of their sockets, in pursuit
of a train of visionary reasoning, like a Highland-seer with his
second sight. The description of Balfour of Burley in his cave,
with his Bible in one hand and his sword in the other, contending
with the imaginary enemy of mankind, gasping for breath, and with
the cold moisture running down his face, gives a lively idea of
Dr. Chalmers’s prophetic fury in the pulpit. If we could have
looked in to have seen Burley hard-beset ‘by the coinage of his heat-oppressed
brain,’ who would have asked whether he was a handsome
man or not? It would be enough to see a man haunted by a spirit,
under the strong and entire dominion of a wilful hallucination. So
the integrity and vehemence of Dr. Chalmers’s manner, the determined
way in which he gives himself up to his subject, or lays about
him and buffets sceptics and gain-sayers, arrests attention in spite of
every other circumstance, and fixes it on that, and that alone, which
excites such interest and such eagerness in his own breast! Besides,
he is a logician, has a theory in support of whatever he chooses to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>advance, and weaves the tissue of his sophistry so close and intricate,
that it is difficult not to be entangled in it, or to escape from it.
‘There’s magic in the web.’ Whatever appeals to the pride of
the human understanding, has a subtle charm in it. The mind is
naturally pugnacious, cannot refuse a challenge of strength or skill,
sturdily enters the lists and resolves to conquer, or to yield itself
vanquished in the forms. This is the chief hold Dr. Chalmers had
upon his hearers, and upon the readers of his ‘Astronomical Discourses.’
No one was satisfied with his arguments, no one could
answer them, but every one wanted to try what he could make of
them, as we try to find out a riddle. ‘By his so potent art,’ the
art of laying down problematical premises, and drawing from them
still more doubtful, but not impossible, conclusions, ‘he could bedim
the noonday sun, betwixt the green sea and the azure vault set
roaring war,’ and almost compel the stars in their courses to testify
to his opinions. The mode in which he undertook to make the
circuit of the universe, and demand categorical information ‘now of
the planetary and now of the fixed,’ might put one in mind of
Hecate’s mode of ascending in a machine from the stage, ‘midst
troops of spirits,’ in which you now admire the skill of the artist,
and next tremble for the fate of the performer, fearing that the
audacity of the attempt will turn his head or break his neck. The
style of these ‘Discourses’ also, though not elegant or poetical, was,
like the subject, intricate and endless. It was that of a man pushing
his way through a labyrinth of difficulties, and determined not to
flinch. The impression on the reader was proportionate; for, whatever
were the merits of the style or matter, both were new and
striking; and the train of thought that was unfolded at such length
and with such strenuousness, was bold, well-sustained, and consistent
with itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Irving wants the continuity of thought and manner which
distinguishes his rival—and shines by patches and in bursts. He
does not warm or acquire increasing force or rapidity with his
progress. He is never hurried away by a deep or lofty enthusiasm,
nor touches the highest point of genius or fanaticism, but ‘in the
very storm and whirlwind of his passion, he acquires and begets a
temperance that may give it smoothness.’ He has the self-possession
and masterly execution of an experienced player or fencer, and does
not seem to express his natural convictions, or to be engaged in a
mortal struggle. This greater ease and indifference is the result of
vast superiority of personal appearance, which ‘to be admired needs
but to be seen,’ and does not require the possessor to work himself
up into a passion, or to use any violent contortions to gain attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>or to keep it. These two celebrated preachers are in almost all
respects an antithesis to each other. If Mr. Irving is an example
of what can be done by the help of external advantages, Dr.
Chalmers is a proof of what can be done without them. The one
is most indebted to his mind, the other to his body. If Mr. Irving
inclines one to suspect fashionable or popular religion of a little
<em>anthropomorphitism</em>, Dr. Chalmers effectually redeems it from that
scandal.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE LATE MR. HORNE TOOKE</h3>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Horne Tooke was one of those who may be considered as
connecting links between a former period and the existing generation.
His education and accomplishments, nay, his political opinions, were
of the last age; his mind, and the tone of his feelings were <em>modern</em>.
There was a hard, dry materialism in the very texture of his understanding,
varnished over by the external refinements of the old school.
Mr. Tooke had great scope of attainment, and great versatility of
pursuit; but the same shrewdness, quickness, cool self-possession, the
same <em>literalness</em> of perception, and absence of passion and enthusiasm,
characterised nearly all he did, said, or wrote. He was without a
rival (almost) in private conversation, an expert public speaker, a
keen politician, a first-rate grammarian, and the finest gentleman (to
say the least) of his own party. He had no imagination (or he
would not have scorned it!)—no delicacy of taste, no rooted
prejudices or strong attachments: his intellect was like a bow of
polished steel, from which he shot sharp-pointed poisoned arrows at
his friends in private, at his enemies in public. His mind (so to
speak) had no <em>religion</em> in it, and very little even of the moral qualities
of genius; but he was a man of the world, a scholar bred, and a
most acute and powerful logician. He was also a wit, and a formidable
one: yet it may be questioned whether his wit was any
thing more than an excess of his logical faculty: it did not consist
in the play of fancy, but in close and cutting combinations of the
understanding. ‘The law is open to every one: <em>so</em>,’ said Mr.
Tooke, ‘<em>is the London Tavern</em>!’ It is the previous deduction
formed in the mind, and the splenetic contempt felt for a practical
sophism, that <em>beats about the bush for</em>, and at last finds the apt illustration;
not the casual, glancing coincidence of two objects, that points
out an absurdity to the understanding. So, on another occasion,
when Sir Allan Gardiner (who was a candidate for Westminster)
had objected to Mr. Fox, that ‘he was always against the minister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span><em>whether right or wrong</em>,’ and Mr. Fox, in his reply, had overlooked
this slip of the tongue, Mr. Tooke immediately seized on it, and
said, ‘he thought it at least an equal objection to Sir Allan, that he
was always <em>with</em> the minister, whether right or wrong.’ This retort
had all the effect, and produced the same surprise as the most
brilliant display of wit or fancy: yet it was only the detecting a flaw
in an argument, like a flaw in an indictment, by a kind of legal
pertinacity, or rather by a rigid and constant habit of attending to
the exact import of every word and clause in a sentence. Mr.
Tooke had the mind of a lawyer; but it was applied to a vast variety
of topics and general trains of speculation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Horne Tooke was in private company, and among his friends,
the finished gentleman of the last age. His manners were as fascinating
as his conversation was spirited and delightful. He put one in
mind of the burden of the song of ‘<cite>The King’s Old Courtier, and an
Old Courtier of the King’s</cite>.’ He was, however, of the opposite party.
It was curious to hear our modern sciolist advancing opinions of the
most radical kind without any mixture of radical heat or violence, in
a tone of fashionable <em>nonchalance</em>, with elegance of gesture and attitude,
and with the most perfect good-humour. In the spirit of opposition,
or in the pride of logical superiority, he too often shocked the
prejudices or wounded the self-love of those about him, while he
himself displayed the same unmoved indifference or equanimity. He
said the most provoking things with a laughing gaiety, and a polite
attention, that there was no withstanding. He threw others off their
guard by thwarting their favourite theories, and then availed himself
of the temperance of his own pulse to chafe them into madness. He
had not one particle of deference for the opinion of others, nor of
sympathy with their feelings; nor had he any obstinate convictions of
his own to defend—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Lord of himself, uncumbered with a <em>creed</em>!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He took up any topic by chance, and played with it at will, like a
juggler with his cups and balls. He generally ranged himself on the
losing side; and had rather an ill-natured delight in contradiction,
and in perplexing the understandings of others, without leaving them
any clue to guide them out of the labyrinth into which he had led
them. He understood, in its perfection, the great art of throwing the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus probandi</span></i> on his adversary; and so could maintain almost any
opinion, however absurd or fantastical, with fearless impunity. I
have heard a sensible and well-informed man say, that he never was in
company with Mr. Tooke without being delighted and surprised, or
without feeling the conversation of every other person to be flat in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>comparison; but that he did not recollect having ever heard him
make a remark that struck him as a sound and true one, or that he
himself appeared to think so. He used to plague Fuseli by asking
him after the origin of the Teutonic dialects, and Dr. Parr, by wishing
to know the meaning of the common copulative, <em>Is</em>. Once at
G——‘s, he defended Pitt from a charge of verbiage, and endeavoured
to prove him superior to Fox. Some one imitated Pitt’s manner, to
show that it was monotonous, and he imitated him also, to show that
it was not. He maintained (what would he not maintain?) that
young Betty’s acting was finer than John Kemble’s, and recited a
passage from Douglas in the manner of each, to justify the preference
he gave to the former. The mentioning of this will please the
living; it cannot hurt the dead. He argued on the same occasion
and in the same breath, that Addison’s style was without modulation,
and that it was physically impossible for any one to write well, who
was habitually silent in company. He sat like a king at his own
table, and gave law to his guests—and to the world! No man knew
better how to manage his immediate circle, to foil or bring them out.
A professed orator, beginning to address some observations to Mr.
Tooke with a voluminous apology for his youth and inexperience, he
said, ‘Speak up, young man!’—and by taking him at his word, cut
short the flower of orations. Porson was the only person of whom he
stood in some degree of awe, on account of his prodigious memory
and knowledge of his favourite subject, Languages. Sheridan, it has
been remarked, said more good things, but had not an equal flow of
pleasantry. As an instance of Mr. Horne Tooke’s extreme coolness
and command of nerve, it has been mentioned that once at a public
dinner when he had got on the table to return thanks for his health
being drank with a glass of wine in his hand, and when there was a
great clamour and opposition for some time, after it had subsided, he
pointed to the glass to show that it was still full. Mr. Holcroft (the
author of the <cite>Road to Ruin</cite>) was one of the most violent and fiery-spirited
of all that motley crew of persons, who attended the Sunday
meetings at Wimbledon. One day he was so enraged by some
paradox or raillery of his host, that he indignantly rose from his chair,
and said, ‘Mr. Tooke, you are a scoundrel!’ His opponent without
manifesting the least emotion, replied, ‘Mr. Holcroft, when is it
that I am to dine with you? shall it be next Thursday?’—‘If you
please, Mr. Tooke!’ answered the angry philosopher, and sat down
again.—It was delightful to see him sometimes turn from these
waspish or ludicrous altercations with over-weening antagonists to
some old friend and veteran politician seated at his elbow; to hear
him recal the time of Wilkes and Liberty, the conversation mellowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>like the wine with the smack of age; assenting to all the old man
said, bringing out his pleasant <em>traits</em>, and pampering him into childish
self-importance, and sending him away thirty years younger than he
came!</p>

<p class='c011'>As a public or at least as a parliamentary speaker, Mr. Tooke did
not answer the expectations that had been conceived of him, or
probably that he had conceived of himself. It is natural for men who
have felt a superiority over all those whom they happen to have
encountered, to fancy that this superiority will continue, and that it
will extend from individuals to public bodies. There is no rule in
the case; or rather, the probability lies the contrary way. That
which constitutes the excellence of conversation is of little use in
addressing large assemblies of people; while other qualities are
required that are hardly to be looked for in one and the same
capacity. The way to move great masses of men is to show that you
yourself are moved. In a private circle, a ready repartee, a shrewd
cross-question, ridicule and banter, a caustic remark or an amusing
anecdote, whatever sets off the individual to advantage, or gratifies
the curiosity or piques the self-love of the hearers, keeps attention
alive, and secures the triumph of the speaker—it is a personal
contest, and depends on personal and momentary advantages. But in
appealing to the public, no one triumphs but in the triumph of some
public cause, or by showing a sympathy with the general and predominant
feelings of mankind. In a private room, a satirist, a
sophist may provoke admiration by expressing his contempt for each
of his adversaries in turn, and by setting their opinion at defiance—but
when men are congregated together on a great public question and
for a weighty object, they must be treated with more respect; they
are touched with what affects themselves or the general weal, not
with what flatters the vanity of the speaker; they must be moved
altogether, if they are moved at all; they are impressed with gratitude
for a luminous exposition of their claims or for zeal in their cause;
and the lightning of generous indignation at bad men and bad
measures is followed by thunders of applause—even in the House of
Commons. But a man may sneer and cavil and puzzle and fly-blow
every question that comes before him—be despised and feared by
others, and admired by no one but himself. He who thinks first of
himself, either in the world or in a popular assembly, will be sure to
turn attention away from his claims, instead of fixing it there. He
must make common cause with his hearers. To lead, he must follow
the general bias. Mr. Tooke did not therefore succeed as a speaker
in parliament. He stood aloof, he played antics, he exhibited his
peculiar talent—while he was on his legs, the question before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>House stood still; the only point at issue respected Mr. Tooke
himself, his personal address and adroitness of intellect. Were there
to be no more places and pensions, because Mr. Tooke’s style was
terse and epigrammatic? Were the Opposition benches to be inflamed
to an unusual pitch of ‘sacred vehemence,’ because he gave them
plainly to understand there was not a pin to choose between Ministers
and Opposition? Would the House let him remain among them,
because, if they turned him out on account of his <em>black coat</em>, Lord
Camelford had threatened to send his <em>black servant</em> in his place?
This was a good joke, but not a practical one. Would he gain the
affections of the people out of doors, by scouting the question of
reform? Would the King ever relish the old associate of Wilkes?
What interest, then, what party did he represent? He represented
nobody but himself. He was an example of an ingenious man, a
clever talker, but he was out of his place in the House of Commons;
where people did not come (as in his own house) to admire or break
a lance with him, but to get through the business of the day, and so
adjourn! He wanted effect and <em>momentum</em>. Each of his sentences
told very well in itself, but they did not altogether make a speech.
He left off where he began. His eloquence was a succession of
drops, not a stream. His arguments, though subtle and new, did not
affect the main body of the question. The coldness and pettiness of
his manner did not warm the hearts or expand the understandings of
his hearers. Instead of encouraging, he checked the ardour of his
friends; and teazed, instead of overpowering his antagonists. The
only palpable hit he ever made, while he remained there, was the
comparing his own situation in being rejected by the House, on
account of the supposed purity of his clerical character, to the story
of the girl at the Magdalen, who was told ‘she must turn out and
qualify.’<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> This met with laughter and loud applause. It was a
<em>home</em> thrust, and the House (to do them justice) are obliged to any
one who, by a smart blow, relieves them of the load of grave
responsibility, which sits heavy on their shoulders.—At the hustings,
or as an election-candidate, Mr. Tooke did better. There was no
great question to move or carry—it was an affair of political <em>sparring</em>
between himself and the other candidates. He took it in a very cool
and leisurely manner—watched his competitors with a wary, sarcastic
eye; picked up the mistakes or absurdities that fell from them, and
retorted them on their heads; told a story to the mob; and smiled
and took snuff with a gentlemanly and becoming air, as if he was
already seated in the House. But a Court of Law was the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>where Mr. Tooke made the best figure in public. He might
assuredly be said to be ‘native and endued unto that element.’ He
had here to stand merely on the defensive—not to advance himself,
but to block up the way—not to impress others, but to be himself
impenetrable. All he wanted was <em>negative success</em>; and to this no
one was better qualified to aspire. Cross purposes, <em>moot-points</em>, pleas,
demurrers, flaws in the indictment, double meanings, cases, inconsequentialities,
these were the playthings, the darlings of Mr. Tooke’s
mind; and with these he baffled the Judge, dumb-founded the Counsel,
and outwitted the Jury. The report of his trial before Lord
Kenyon is a masterpiece of acuteness, dexterity, modest assurance,
and legal effect. It is much like his examination before the
Commissioners of the Income-Tax—nothing could be got out of him
in either case!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Tooke, as a political leader, belonged to the class of <em>trimmers</em>;
or at most, it was his delight to make mischief and spoil sport. He
would rather be <em>against</em> himself than <em>for</em> any body else. He was neither
a bold nor a safe leader. He enticed others into scrapes, and kept out
of them himself. Provided he could say a clever or a spiteful thing,
he did not care whether it served or injured the cause. Spleen or
the exercise of intellectual power was the motive of his patriotism,
rather than principle. He would talk treason with a saving clause;
and instil sedition into the public mind, through the medium of a
third (who was to be the responsible) party. He made Sir Francis
Burdett his spokesman in the House and to the country, often venting
his chagrin or singularity of sentiment at the expense of his friend;
but what in the first was trick or reckless vanity, was in the last plain
downright English honesty and singleness of heart. In the case of
the State Trials, in 1794, Mr. Tooke rather compromised his friends
to screen himself. He kept repeating that ‘others might have gone
on to Windsor, but he had stopped at Hounslow,’ as if to go farther
might have been dangerous and unwarrantable. It was not the
question how far he or others had actually gone, but how far they
had a right to go, according to the law. His conduct was not the
limit of the law, nor did treasonable excess begin where prudence or
principle taught him to stop short, though this was the oblique inference
liable to be drawn from his line of defence. Mr. Tooke was
uneasy and apprehensive for the issue of the Government-prosecution
while in confinement, and said, in speaking of it to a friend, with a
morbid feeling and an emphasis quite unusual with him—‘They want
our blood—blood—blood!’ It was somewhat ridiculous to implicate
Mr. Tooke in a charge of High Treason (and indeed the whole
charge was built on the mistaken purport of an intercepted letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>relating to an engagement for a private dinner-party)—his politics
were not at all revolutionary. In this respect he was a mere pettifogger,
full of chicane, and captious objections, and unmeaning
discontent; but he had none of the grand whirling movements of the
French Revolution, nor of the tumultuous glow of rebellion in his
head or in his heart. His politics were cast in a different mould, or
confined to the party distinctions and court intrigues and pittances of
popular right, that made a noise in the time of Junius and Wilkes—and
even if his understanding had gone along with more modern and
unqualified principles, his cautious temper would have prevented his
risking them in practice. Horne Tooke (though not of the same
side in politics) had much of the tone of mind and more of the spirit
of moral feeling of the celebrated philosopher of Malmesbury. The
narrow scale and fine-drawn distinctions of his political creed made
his conversation on such subjects infinitely amusing, particularly when
contrasted with that of persons who dealt in the sounding <em>common-places</em>
and sweeping clauses of abstract politics. He knew all the
cabals and jealousies and heart-burnings in the beginning of the late
reign, the changes of administration and the springs of secret influence,
the characters of the leading men, Wilkes, Barre, Dunning,
Chatham, Burke, the Marquis of Rockingham, North, Shelburne,
Fox, Pitt, and all the vacillating events of the American war:—these
formed a curious back-ground to the more prominent figures
that occupied the present time, and Mr. Tooke worked out the
minute details and touched in the evanescent <em>traits</em> with the pencil of
a master. His conversation resembled a political <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">camera obscura</span></i>—as
quaint as it was magical. To some pompous pretenders he might
seem to narrate <em>fabellas aniles</em> (old wives’ fables)—but not to those
who study human nature, and wish to know the materials of which
it is composed. Mr. Tooke’s faculties might appear to have ripened
and acquired a finer flavour with age. In a former period of his life
he was hardly the man he was latterly; or else he had greater
abilities to contend against. He no where makes so poor a figure as
in his controversy with Junius. He has evidently the best of the
argument, yet he makes nothing out of it. He tells a long story
about himself, without wit or point in it; and whines and whimpers
like a school-boy under the rod of his master. Junius, after bringing
a hasty charge against him, has not a single fact to adduce in support
of it; but keeps his ground and fairly beats his adversary out of the
field by the mere force of style. One would think that ‘Parson
Horne’ knew who Junius was, and was afraid of him. ‘Under him
his genius is’ quite ‘rebuked.’ With the best cause to defend, he
comes off more shabbily from the contest than any other person in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the <span class='sc'>Letters</span>, except Sir William Draper, who is the very hero of
defeat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great thing which Mr. Horne Tooke has done, and which he
has left behind him to posterity, is his work on Grammar, oddly
enough entitled <span class='sc'>The Diversions of Purley</span>. Many people have
taken it up as a description of a game—others supposing it to be a
novel. It is, in truth, one of the few philosophical works on
Grammar that were ever written. The essence of it (and, indeed,
almost all that is really valuable in it) is contained in his <cite>Letter to
Dunning</cite>, published about the year 1775. Mr. Tooke’s work is
truly elementary. Dr. Lowth described Mr. Harris’s <cite>Hermes</cite> as
‘the finest specimen of analysis since the days of Aristotle’—a work
in which there is no analysis at all, for analysis consists in reducing
things to their principles, and not in endless details and subdivisions.
Mr. Harris multiplies distinctions, and confounds his readers. Mr.
Tooke clears away the rubbish of school-boy technicalities, and
strikes at the root of his subject. In accomplishing his arduous
task, he was, perhaps, aided not more by the strength and resources of
his mind than by its limits and defects. There is a web of old
associations wound round language, that is a kind of veil over its
natural features; and custom puts on the mask of ignorance. But
this veil, this mask the author of <cite>The Diversions of Purley</cite> threw aside
and penetrated to the naked truth of things, by the literal, matter-of-fact,
unimaginative nature of his understanding, and because he was
not subject to prejudices or illusions of any kind. Words may be
said to ‘bear a charmed life, that must not yield to one of woman
born’—with womanish weaknesses and confused apprehensions. But
this charm was broken in the case of Mr. Tooke, whose mind was
the reverse of effeminate—hard, unbending, concrete, physical, half-savage—and
who saw language stripped of the clothing of habit or
sentiment, or the disguises of doting pedantry, naked in its cradle,
and in its primitive state. Our author tells us that he found his discovery
on Grammar among a number of papers on other subjects,
which he had thrown aside and forgotten. Is this an idle boast?
Or had he made other discoveries of equal importance, which he did
not think it worth his while to communicate to the world, but chose
to die the churl of knowledge? The whole of his reasoning turns
upon showing that the Conjunction <em>That</em> is the pronoun <em>That</em>, which
is itself the participle of a verb, and in like manner that all the other
mystical and hitherto unintelligible parts of speech are derived from
the only two intelligible ones, the Verb and Noun. ‘I affirm <em>that</em>
gold is yellow,’ that is, ‘I affirm <em>that</em> fact, or that proposition, viz.
gold is yellow.’ The secret of the Conjunction on which so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>fine heads had split, on which so many learned definitions were thrown
away, as if it was its peculiar province and inborn virtue to announce
oracles and formal propositions, and nothing else, like a Doctor of
Laws, is here at once accounted for, inasmuch as it is clearly nothing
but another part of speech, the pronoun, <em>that</em>, with a third part of
speech, the noun, <em>thing</em>, understood. This is getting at a solution of
words into their component parts, not glossing over one difficulty by
bringing another to parallel it, nor like saying with Mr. Harris, when
it is asked, ‘what a Conjunction is?’ that there are conjunctions
copulative, conjunctions disjunctive, and as many other frivolous
varieties of the species as any one chooses to hunt out ‘with laborious
foolery.’ Our author hit upon his parent-discovery in the course of
a lawsuit, while he was examining, with jealous watchfulness, the
meaning of words to prevent being entrapped by them; or rather,
this circumstance might itself be traced to the habit of satisfying his
own mind as to the precise sense in which he himself made use of
words. Mr. Tooke, though he had no objection to puzzle others,
was mightily averse to being puzzled or <em>mystified</em> himself. All was,
to his determined mind, either complete light or complete darkness.
There was no hazy, doubtful <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i> in his understanding. He
wanted something ‘palpable to feeling as to sight.’ ‘What,’ he
would say to himself, ‘do I mean when I use the conjunction <em>that</em>?
Is it an anomaly, a class by itself, a word sealed against all inquisitive
attempts? Is it enough to call it a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">copula</span></i>, a bridge, a link, a word
connecting sentences? That is undoubtedly its use, but what is its
origin?’ Mr. Tooke thought he had answered this question satisfactorily,
and loosened the Gordian knot of grammarians, ‘familiar as
his garter,’ when he said, ‘It is the common pronoun, adjective, or
participle, <em>that</em>, with the noun, <em>thing or proposition</em>, implied, and the
particular example following it.’ So he thought, and so every reader
has thought since, with the exception of teachers and writers upon
Grammar. Mr. Windham, indeed, who was a sophist, but not a
logician, charged him with having found ‘a mare’s-nest’; but it is
not to be doubted that Mr. Tooke’s etymologies will stand the test,
and last longer than Mr. Windham’s ingenious derivation of the
practice of bull-baiting from the principles of humanity!</p>

<p class='c011'>Having thus laid the corner-stone, he proceeded to apply the same
method of reasoning to other undecyphered and impracticable terms.
Thus the word, <em>And</em>, he explained clearly enough to be the verb <em>add</em>,
or a corruption of the old Saxon, <em>anandad</em>. ‘Two <em>and</em> two make
four,’ that is, ‘two <em>add</em> two make four.’ Mr. Tooke, in fact, treated
words as the chemists do substances; he separated those which are
compounded of others from those which are not decompoundable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>He did not explain the obscure by the more obscure, but the difficult
by the plain, the complex by the simple. This alone is proceeding
upon the true principles of science: the rest is pedantry and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maîtreship</span></i>.
Our philosophical writer distinguished all words into
<em>names of things</em>, and directions added for joining them together, or
originally into <em>nouns</em> and <em>verbs</em>. It is a pity that he has left this
matter short, by omitting to define the Verb. After enumerating
sixteen different definitions (all of which he dismisses with scorn and
contumely) at the end of two quarto volumes, he refers the reader for
the true solution to a third volume, which he did not live to finish.
This extraordinary man was in the habit of tantalizing his guests on a
Sunday afternoon with sundry abstruse speculations, and putting them
off to the following week for a satisfaction of their doubts; but why
should he treat posterity in the same scurvy manner, or leave the
world without quitting scores with it? I question whether Mr.
Tooke was himself in possession of his pretended <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nostrum</span></i>, and
whether, after trying hard at a definition of the verb as a distinct
part of speech, as a terrier-dog mumbles a hedge-hog, he did not find
it too much for him, and leave it to its fate. It is also a pity that
Mr. Tooke spun out his great work with prolix and dogmatical dissertations
on irrelevant matters; and after denying the old metaphysical
theories of language, should attempt to found a metaphysical
theory of his own on the nature and mechanism of language. The
nature of words, he contended (it was the basis of his whole system)
had no connection with the nature of things or the objects of thought;
yet he afterwards strove to limit the nature of things and of the human
mind by the technical structure of language. Thus he endeavours to
show that there are no abstract ideas, by enumerating two thousand
instances of words, expressing abstract ideas, that are the past
participles of certain verbs. It is difficult to know what he means
by this. On the other hand, he maintains that ‘a complex idea is as
great an absurdity as a complex star,’ and that words only are complex.
He also makes out a triumphant list of metaphysical and
moral non-entities, proved to be so on the pure principle that the
names of these non-entities are participles, not nouns, or names of
things. That is strange in so close a reasoner, and in one who maintained
that all language was a masquerade of words, and that the class
to which they grammatically belonged had nothing to do with the
class of ideas they represented.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is now above twenty years since the two quarto volumes of the
<cite>Diversions of Purley</cite> were published, and fifty since the same theory
was promulgated in the celebrated <cite>Letter to Dunning</cite>. Yet it is a
curious example of the <cite>Spirit of the Age</cite> that Mr. Lindley Murray’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Grammar (a work out of which Mr. C*** helps himself to English,
and Mr. M*** to style<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a>) has proceeded to the thirtieth edition in
complete defiance of all the facts and arguments there laid down.
He defines a noun to be the name of a thing. Is quackery a thing,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> a substance? He defines a verb to be a word signifying <em>to be, to
do, or to suffer</em>. Are being, action, suffering, verbs? He defines an
adjective to be the name of a quality. Are not <em>wooden</em>, <em>golden</em>, <em>substantial</em>
adjectives? He maintains that there are six cases in English
nouns, that is, six various terminations without any change of termination
at all,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and that English verbs have all the moods, tenses, and
persons that the Latin ones have. This is an extraordinary stretch
of blindness and obstinacy. He very formally translates the Latin
Grammar into English, (as so many had done before him) and
fancies he has written an English Grammar; and divines applaud,
and schoolmasters usher him into the polite world, and English
scholars carry on the jest, while Horne Tooke’s genuine anatomy
of our native tongue is laid on the shelf. Can it be that our
politicians smell a rat in the Member for Old Sarum? That our
clergy do not relish Parson Horne? That the world at large are
alarmed at acuteness and originality greater than their own? What
has all this to do with the formation of the English language or with
the first conditions and necessary foundation of speech itself? Is
there nothing beyond the reach of prejudice and party-spirit? It
seems in this, as in so many other instances, as if there was a patent
for absurdity in the natural bias of the human mind, and that folly
should be <em>stereotyped</em>!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>SIR WALTER SCOTT</h3>

<p class='c008'>Sir Walter Scott is undoubtedly the most popular writer of the
age—the ‘lord of the ascendant’ for the time being. He is just
half what the human intellect is capable of being: if you take the
universe, and divide it into two parts, he knows all that it <em>has been</em>;
all that it <em>is to be</em> is nothing to him. His is a mind brooding over
antiquity—scorning ‘the present ignorant time.’ He is ‘laudator
temporis acti’—a ‘<em>prophesier</em> of things past.’ The old world is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>him a crowded map; the new one a dull, hateful blank. He dotes
on all well-authenticated superstitions; he shudders at the shadow of
innovation. His retentiveness of memory, his accumulated weight of
interested prejudice or romantic association have overlaid his other
faculties. The cells of his memory are vast, various, full even to
bursting with life and motion; his speculative understanding is empty,
flaccid, poor, and dead. His mind receives and treasures up every
thing brought to it by tradition or custom—it does not project itself
beyond this into the world unknown, but mechanically shrinks back
as from the edge of a precipice. The land of pure reason is to his
apprehension like <em>Van Dieman’s Land</em>;—barren, miserable, distant,
a place of exile, the dreary abode of savages, convicts, and adventurers.
Sir Walter would make a bad hand of a description of the <cite>Millennium</cite>,
unless he could lay the scene in Scotland five hundred years ago, and
then he would want facts and worm-eaten parchments to support his
drooping style. Our historical novelist firmly thinks that nothing <em>is</em>
but what <em>has been</em>—that the moral world stands still, as the material
one was supposed to do of old—and that we can never get beyond
the point where we actually are without utter destruction, though
every thing changes and will change from what it was three hundred
years ago to what it is now,—from what it is now to all that the
bigoted admirer of the good old times most dreads and hates!</p>

<p class='c011'>It is long since we read, and long since we thought of our author’s
poetry. It would probably have gone out of date with the immediate
occasion, even if he himself had not contrived to banish it from our
recollection. It is not to be denied that it had great merit, both of
an obvious and intrinsic kind. It abounded in vivid descriptions, in
spirited action, in smooth and flowing versification. But it wanted
<em>character</em>. It was ‘poetry of no mark or likelihood.’ It slid out of
the mind as soon as read, like a river; and would have been forgotten,
but that the public curiosity was fed with ever new supplies from the
same teeming liquid source. It is not every man that can write six
quarto volumes in verse, that are caught up with avidity, even by
fastidious judges. But what a difference between <em>their</em> popularity and
that of the Scotch Novels! It is true, the public read and admired
the <cite>Lay of the last Minstrel</cite>, <cite>Marmion</cite>, and so on, and each individual
was contented to read and admire because the public did so: but
with regard to the prose-works of the same (supposed) author, it is
quite <em>another-guess</em> sort of thing. Here every one stands forward to
applaud on his own ground, would be thought to go before the public
opinion, is eager to extol his favourite characters louder, to understand
them better than every body else, and has his own scale of comparative
excellence for each work, supported by nothing but his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>enthusiastic and fearless convictions. It must be amusing to the
<em>Author of Waverley</em> to hear his readers and admirers (and are not
these the same thing?<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a>) quarrelling which of his novels is the best,
opposing character to character, quoting passage against passage,
striving to surpass each other in the extravagance of their encomiums,
and yet unable to settle the precedence, or to do the author’s writings
justice—so various, so equal, so transcendant are their merits! His
volumes of poetry were received as fashionable and well-dressed
acquaintances: we are ready to tear the others in pieces as old
friends. There was something meretricious in Sir Walter’s ballad-rhymes;
and like those who keep opera <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">figurantes</span></i>, we were willing
to have our admiration shared, and our taste confirmed by the town:
but the Novels are like the betrothed of our hearts, bone of our bone,
and flesh of our flesh, and we are jealous that any one should be as
much delighted or as thoroughly acquainted with their beauties as
ourselves. For which of his poetical heroines would the reader
break a lance so soon as for Jeanie Deans? What <cite>Lady of the Lake</cite>
can compare with the beautiful Rebecca? We believe the late
Mr. John Scott went to his death-bed (though a painful and premature
one) with some degree of satisfaction, inasmuch as he had penned
the most elaborate panegyric on the <cite>Scotch Novels</cite> that had as yet
appeared!—The <cite>Epics</cite> are not poems, so much as metrical romances.
There is a glittering veil of verse thrown over the features of nature
and of old romance. The deep incisions into character are ‘skinned
and filmed over’—the details are lost or shaped into flimsy and
insipid decorum; and the truth of feeling and of circumstance is
translated into a tinkling sound, a tinsel <em>common-place</em>. It must be
owned, there is a power in true poetry that lifts the mind from the
ground of reality to a higher sphere, that penetrates the inert,
scattered, incoherent materials presented to it, and by a force and
inspiration of its own, melts and moulds them into sublimity and
beauty. But Sir Walter (we contend, under correction) has not this
creative impulse, this plastic power, this capacity of reacting on his
first impressions. He is a learned, a literal, a <em>matter-of-fact</em> expounder
of truth or fable:<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> he does not soar above and look down upon his
subject, imparting his own lofty views and feelings to his descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of nature—he relies upon it, is raised by it, is one with it, or he is
nothing. A poet is essentially a <em>maker</em>; that is, he must atone for
what he loses in individuality and local resemblance by the energies
and resources of his own mind. The writer of whom we speak is
deficient in these last. He has either not the faculty or not the will
to impregnate his subject by an effort of pure invention. The
execution also is much upon a par with the more ephemeral effusions
of the press. It is light, agreeable, effeminate, diffuse. Sir Walter’s
Muse is a <cite>Modern Antique</cite>. The smooth, glossy texture of his verse
contrasts happily with the quaint, uncouth, rugged materials of which
it is composed; and takes away any appearance of heaviness or
harshness from the body of local traditions and obsolete costume.
We see grim knights and iron armour; but then they are woven in
silk with a careless, delicate hand, and have the softness of flowers.
The poet’s figures might be compared to old tapestries copied on the
finest velvet:—they are not like Raphael’s <cite>Cartoons</cite>, but they are
very like Mr. Westall’s drawings, which accompany, and are intended
to illustrate them. This facility and grace of execution is the more
remarkable, as a story goes that not long before the appearance of the
<cite>Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite> Sir Walter (then Mr.) Scott, having, in
the company of a friend, to cross the Frith of Forth in a ferry-boat,
they proposed to beguile the time by writing a number of verses on a
given subject, and that at the end of an hour’s hard study, they found
they had produced only six lines between them. ‘It is plain,’ said
the unconscious author to his fellow-labourer, ‘that you and I need
never think of getting our living by writing poetry!’ In a year or
so after this, he set to work, and poured out quarto upon quarto, as if
they had been drops of water. As to the rest, and compared with
true and great poets, our Scottish Minstrel is but ‘a metre ballad-monger.’
We would rather have written one song of Burns, or
a single passage in Lord Byron’s <cite>Heaven and Earth</cite>, or one of
Wordsworth’s ‘fancies and good-nights,’ than all his epics. What
is he to Spenser, over whose immortal, ever-amiable verse beauty
hovers and trembles, and who has shed the purple light of Fancy,
from his ambrosial wings, over all nature? What is there of the
might of Milton, whose head is canopied in the blue serene, and who
takes us to sit with him there? What is there (in his ambling
rhymes) of the deep pathos of Chaucer? Or of the o’er-informing
power of Shakespear, whose eye, watching alike the minutest traces
of characters and the strongest movements of passion, ‘glances from
heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,’ and with the lambent flame
of genius, playing round each object, lights up the universe in a
robe of its own radiance? Sir Walter has no voluntary power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>combination: all his associations (as we said before) are those of
habit or of tradition. He is a mere narrative and descriptive poet,
garrulous of the old time. The definition of his poetry is a pleasing
superficiality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not so of his <span class='sc'>Novels and Romances</span>. There we turn over a new
leaf—another and the same—the same in matter, but in form, in
power how different! The author of Waverley has got rid of the
tagging of rhymes, the eking out of syllables, the supplying of epithets,
the colours of style, the grouping of his characters, and the regular
march of events, and comes to the point at once, and strikes at the
heart of his subject, without dismay and without disguise. His
poetry was a lady’s waiting-maid, dressed out in cast-off finery: his
prose is a beautiful, rustic nymph, that, like Dorothea in Don Quixote,
when she is surprised with dishevelled tresses bathing her naked feet
in the brook, looks round her, abashed at the admiration her charms
have excited! The grand secret of the author’s success in these
latter productions is that he has completely got rid of the trammels of
authorship; and torn off at one rent (as Lord Peter got rid of so
many yards of lace in the <cite>Tale of a Tub</cite>) all the ornaments of fine
writing and worn-out sentimentality. All is fresh, as from the hand
of nature: by going a century or two back and laying the scene in a
remote and uncultivated district, all becomes new and startling in the
present advanced period.—Highland manners, characters, scenery,
superstitions, Northern dialect and costume, the wars, the religion,
and politics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, give a
charming and wholesome relief to the fastidious refinement and ‘over-laboured
lassitude’ of modern readers, like the effect of plunging
a nervous valetudinarian into a cold-bath. The <cite>Scotch Novels</cite>, for
this reason, are not so much admired in Scotland as in England. The
contrast, the transition is less striking. From the top of the Calton
Hill, the inhabitants of ‘Auld Reekie’ can descry, or fancy they
descry the peaks of Ben Lomond and the waving outline of Rob
Roy’s country: we who live at the southern extremity of the island
can only catch a glimpse of the billowy scene in the descriptions of
the Author of Waverley. The mountain air is most bracing to our
languid nerves, and it is brought us in ship-loads from the neighbourhood
of Abbot’s Ford. There is another circumstance to be taken
into the account. In Edinburgh there is a little opposition and
something of the spirit of cabal between the partisans of works proceeding
from Mr. Constable’s and Mr. Blackwood’s shops. Mr.
Constable gives the highest prices; but being the Whig bookseller, it
is grudged that he should do so. An attempt is therefore made to
transfer a certain share of popularity to the second-rate Scotch novels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>‘the embryo fry, the little airy of <em>ricketty</em> children,’ issuing through
Mr. Blackwood’s shop-door. This operates a diversion, which does
not affect us here. The Author of Waverley wears the palm of
legendary lore alone. Sir Walter may, indeed, surfeit us: his
imitators make us sick! It may be asked, it has been asked, ‘Have
we no materials for romance in England? Must we look to Scotland
for a supply of whatever is original and striking in this kind?’ And we
answer—‘Yes!’ Every foot of soil is with us worked up: nearly
every movement of the social machine is calculable. We have no room
left for violent catastrophes; for grotesque quaintnesses; for wizard
spells. The last skirts of ignorance and barbarism are seen hovering
(in Sir Walter’s pages) over the Border. We have, it is true,
gipsies in this country as well as at the Cairn of Derncleugh: but
they live under clipped hedges, and repose in camp-beds, and do not
perch on crags, like eagles, or take shelter, like sea-mews, in basaltic
subterranean caverns. We have heaths with rude heaps of stones
upon them: but no existing superstition converts them into the Geese
of Micklestane-Moor, or sees a Black Dwarf groping among them.
We have sects in religion: but the only thing sublime or ridiculous in
that way is Mr. Irving, the Caledonian preacher, who ‘comes like a
satyr staring from the woods, and yet speaks like an orator!’ We
had a Parson Adams not quite a hundred years ago—a Sir Roger de
Coverley rather more than a hundred! Even Sir Walter is ordinarily
obliged to pitch his angle (strong as the hook is) a hundred miles
to the North of the ‘Modern Athens’ or a century back. His last
work,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> indeed, is mystical, is romantic in nothing but the title-page.
Instead of ‘a holy-water sprinkle dipped in dew,’ he has given us a
fashionable watering-place—and we see what he has made of it. He
must not come down from his fastnesses in traditional barbarism and
native rusticity; the level, the littleness, the frippery of modern
civilization will undo him as it has undone us!</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Walter has found out (oh, rare discovery) that facts are better
than fiction; that there is no romance like the romance of real life;
and that if we can but arrive at what men feel, do, and say in striking
and singular situations, the result will be ‘more lively, audible, and
full of vent,’ than the fine-spun cobwebs of the brain. With reverence
be it spoken, he is like the man who having to imitate the squeaking
of a pig upon the stage, brought the animal under his coat with him.
Our author has conjured up the actual people he has to deal with, or
as much as he could get of them, in ‘their habits as they lived.’ He
has ransacked old chronicles, and poured the contents upon his page;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>he has squeezed out musty records; he has consulted wayfaring
pilgrims, bed-rid sibyls; he has invoked the spirits of the air; he has
conversed with the living and the dead, and let them tell their story
their own way; and by borrowing of others, has enriched his own
genius with everlasting variety, truth, and freedom. He has taken
his materials from the original, authentic sources, in large concrete
masses, and not tampered with or too much frittered them away.
He is only the amanuensis of truth and history. It is impossible to
say how fine his writings in consequence are, unless we could describe
how fine nature is. All that portion of the history of his country
that he has touched upon (wide as the scope is) the manners, the
personages, the events, the scenery, lives over again in his volumes.
Nothing is wanting—the illusion is complete. There is a hurtling in
the air, a trampling of feet upon the ground, as these perfect representations
of human character or fanciful belief come thronging back
upon our imaginations. We will merely recall a few of the subjects
of his pencil to the reader’s recollection; for nothing we could add,
by way of note or commendation, could make the impression more
vivid.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is (first and foremost, because the earliest of our acquaintance)
the Baron of Bradwardine, stately, kind-hearted, whimsical,
pedantic; and Flora MacIvor (whom even <em>we</em> forgive for her
Jacobitism), the fierce Vich Ian Vohr, and Evan Dhu, constant in
death, and Davie Gellatly roasting his eggs or turning his rhymes
with restless volubility, and the two stag-hounds that met Waverley,
as fine as ever Titian painted, or Paul Veronese:—then there is old
Balfour of Burley, brandishing his sword and his Bible with fire-eyed
fury, trying a fall with the insolent, gigantic Bothwell at the ‘Changehouse,
and vanquishing him at the noble battle of Loudon-hill; there
is Bothwell himself, drawn to the life, proud, cruel, selfish, profligate,
but with the love-letters of the gentle Alice (written thirty years
before), and his verses to her memory, found in his pocket after his
death: in the same volume of <cite>Old Mortality</cite> is that lone figure, like a
figure in Scripture, of the woman sitting on the stone at the turning
to the mountain, to warn Burley that there is a lion in his path; and
the fawning Claverhouse, beautiful as a panther, smooth-looking,
blood-spotted; and the fanatics, Macbriar and Mucklewrath, crazed
with zeal and sufferings; and the inflexible Morton, and the faithful
Edith, who refused to ‘give her hand to another while her heart was
with her lover in the deep and dead sea.’ And in <cite>The Heart of Mid
Lothian</cite> we have Effie Deans (that sweet, faded flower) and Jeanie,
her more than sister, and old David Deans, the patriarch of St.
Leonard’s Crags, and Butler, and Dumbiedikes, eloquent in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>silence, and Mr. Bartoline Saddle-tree and his prudent helpmate, and
Porteous swinging in the wind, and Madge Wildfire, full of finery
and madness, and her ghastly mother.—Again, there is Meg
Merrilies, standing on her rock, stretched on her bier with ‘her head
to the east,’ and Dirk Hatterick (equal to Shakespear’s Master
Barnardine), and Glossin, the soul of an attorney, and Dandy
Dinmont, with his terrier-pack and his pony Dumple, and the fiery
Colonel Mannering, and the modish old counsellor Pleydell, and
Dominie Sampson,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and Rob Roy (like the eagle in his eyry), and
Baillie Nicol Jarvie, and the inimitable Major Galbraith, and
Rashleigh Osbaldistone, and Die Vernon, the best of secret-keepers;
and in the <cite>Antiquary</cite>, the ingenious and abstruse Mr. Jonathan
Oldbuck, and the old beadsman Edie Ochiltree, and that preternatural
figure of old Edith Elspeith, a living shadow, in whom the lamp of
life had been long extinguished, had it not been fed by remorse and
‘thick-coming’ recollections; and that striking picture of the effects
of feudal tyranny and fiendish pride, the unhappy Earl of Glenallan;
and the Black Dwarf, and his friend Habby of the Heughfoot (the
cheerful hunter), and his cousin Grace Armstrong, fresh and laughing
like the morning; and the <cite>Children of the Mist</cite>, and the baying of
the blood-hound that tracks their steps at a distance (the hollow
echoes are in our ears now), and Amy and her hapless love, and the
villain Varney, and the deep voice of George of Douglas—and the
immoveable Balafre, and Master Oliver the Barber in Quentin
Durward—and the quaint humour of the Fortunes of Nigel, and the
comic spirit of Peveril of the Peak—and the fine old English romance
of Ivanhoe. What a list of names! What a host of associations!
What a thing is human life! What a power is that of genius!
What a world of thought and feeling is thus rescued from oblivion!
How many hours of heartfelt satisfaction has our author given to the
gay and thoughtless! How many sad hearts has he soothed in
pain and solitude! It is no wonder that the public repay with
lengthened applause and gratitude the pleasure they receive. He
writes as fast as they can read, and he does not write himself down.
He is always in the public eye, and we do not tire of him. His
worst is better than any other person’s best. His <em>back-grounds</em> (and
his later works are little else but back-grounds capitally made out)
are more attractive than the principal figures and most complicated
actions of other writers. His works (taken together) are almost like
a new edition of human nature. This is indeed to be an author!</p>

<p class='c011'>The political bearing of the <cite>Scotch Novels</cite> has been a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>recommendation to them. They are a relief to the mind, rarefied as
it has been with modern philosophy, and heated with ultra-radicalism.
At a time also, when we bid fair to revive the principles of the
Stuarts, it is interesting to bring us acquainted with their persons and
misfortunes. The candour of Sir Walter’s historic pen levels our
bristling prejudices on this score, and sees fair play between Roundheads
and Cavaliers, between Protestant and Papist. He is a writer
reconciling all the diversities of human nature to the reader. He
does not enter into the distinctions of hostile sects or parties, but
treats of the strength or the infirmity of the human mind, of the
virtues or vices of the human breast, as they are to be found blended
in the whole race of mankind. Nothing can show more handsomely
or be more gallantly executed. There was a talk at one time that
our author was about to take Guy Faux for the subject of one of his
novels, in order to put a more liberal and humane construction on the
Gunpowder Plot than our ‘No Popery’ prejudices have hitherto
permitted. Sir Walter is a professed <em>clarifier</em> of the age from the
vulgar and still lurking old-English antipathy to Popery and Slavery.
Through some odd process of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">servile</span></i> logic, it should seem, that in
restoring the claims of the Stuarts by the courtesy of romance, the
House of Brunswick are more firmly seated in point of fact, and the
Bourbons, by collateral reasoning, become legitimate! In any other
point of view, we cannot possibly conceive how Sir Walter imagines
‘he has done something to revive the declining spirit of loyalty’ by
these novels. His loyalty is founded on <em>would-be</em> treason: he props
the actual throne by the shadow of rebellion. Does he really think
of making us enamoured of the ‘good old times’ by the faithful and
harrowing portraits he has drawn of them? Would he carry us back
to the early stages of barbarism, of clanship, of the feudal system as
‘a consummation devoutly to be wished?’ Is he infatuated
enough, or does he so dote and drivel over his own slothful and
self-willed prejudices, as to believe that he will make a single convert
to the beauty of Legitimacy, that is, of lawless power and savage
bigotry, when he himself is obliged to apologise for the horrors he
describes, and even render his descriptions credible to the modern
reader by referring to the authentic history of these delectable
times?<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> He is indeed so besotted as to the moral of his own story,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that he has even the blindness to go out of his way to have a fling at
<em>flints</em> and <em>dungs</em> (the contemptible ingredients, as he would have us
believe, of a modern rabble) at the very time when he is describing a
mob of the twelfth century—a mob (one should think) after the
writer’s own heart, without one particle of modern philosophy or
revolutionary politics in their composition, who were to a man, to a
hair, just what priests, and kings, and nobles <em>let</em> them be, and who
were collected to witness (a spectacle proper to the times) the
burning of the lovely Rebecca at a stake for a sorceress, because she
was a Jewess, beautiful and innocent, and the consequent victim of
insane bigotry and unbridled profligacy. And it is at this moment
(when the heart is kindled and bursting with indignation at the
revolting abuses of self-constituted power) that Sir Walter <em>stops the
press</em> to have a sneer at the people, and to put a spoke (as he thinks)
in the wheel of upstart innovation! This is what he ‘calls backing
his friends’—it is thus he administers charms and philtres to our
love of Legitimacy, makes us conceive a horror of all reform, civil,
political, or religious, and would fain put down the <cite>Spirit of the Age</cite>.
The author of Waverley might just as well get up and make a speech
at a dinner at Edinburgh, abusing Mr. Mac-Adam for his improvements
in the roads, on the ground that they were nearly <em>impassable</em> in
many places ‘sixty years since’; or object to Mr. Peel’s <cite>Police-Bill</cite>,
by insisting that Hounslow-Heath was formerly a scene of greater
interest and terror to highwaymen and travellers, and cut a greater
figure in the Newgate Calendar than it does at present.—Oh!
Wickliff, Luther, Hampden, Sidney, Somers, mistaken Whigs, and
thoughtless Reformers in religion and politics, and all ye, whether
poets or philosophers, heroes or sages, inventors of arts or sciences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>patriots, benefactors of the human race, enlighteners and civilisers of
the world, who have (so far) reduced opinion to reason, and power
to law, who are the cause that we no longer burn witches and
heretics at slow fires, that the thumb-screws are no longer applied by
ghastly, smiling judges, to extort confession of imputed crimes from
sufferers for conscience sake; that men are no longer strung up like
acorns on trees without judge or jury, or hunted like wild beasts
through thickets and glens, who have abated the cruelty of priests, the
pride of nobles, the divinity of kings in former times; to whom we
owe it, that we no longer wear round our necks the collar of Gurth
the swineherd, and of Wamba the jester; that the castles of great
lords are no longer the dens of banditti, from whence they issue with
fire and sword, to lay waste the land; that we no longer expire in
loathsome dungeons without knowing the cause, or have our right
hands struck off for raising them in self-defence against wanton
insult; that we can sleep without fear of being burnt in our beds, or
travel without making our wills; that no Amy Robsarts are thrown
down trap-doors by Richard Varneys with impunity; that no Red
Reiver of Westburn-Flat sets fire to peaceful cottages; that no Claverhouse
signs cold-blooded death-warrants in sport; that we have no
Tristan the Hermit, or Petit-André, crawling near us, like spiders,
and making our flesh creep, and our hearts sicken within us at
every moment of our lives—ye who have produced this change in
the face of nature and society, return to earth once more, and beg
pardon of Sir Walter and his patrons, who sigh at not being able to
undo all that you have done! Leaving this question, there are two
other remarks which we wished to make on the Novels. The one
was, to express our admiration of the good-nature of the mottos, in
which the author has taken occasion to remember and quote almost
every living author (whether illustrious or obscure) but himself—an
indirect argument in favour of the general opinion as to the source
from which they spring—and the other was, to hint our astonishment
at the innumerable and incessant instances of bad and slovenly
English in them, more, we believe, than in any other works now
printed. We should think the writer could not possibly read the
manuscript after he has once written it, or overlook the press.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>future good of mankind—who, raised by affluence, the reward of
successful industry, and by the voice of fame above the want of any
but the most honourable patronage, stooped to the unworthy arts of
adulation, and abetted the views of the great with the pettifogging
feelings of the meanest dependant on office—who, having secured the
admiration of the public (with the probable reversion of immortality),
showed no respect for himself, for that genius that had raised him to
distinction, for that nature which he trampled under foot—who,
amiable, frank, friendly, manly in private life, was seized with the
dotage of age and the fury of a woman, the instant politics were concerned—who
reserved all his candour and comprehensiveness of view
for history, and vented his littleness, pique, resentment, bigotry, and
intolerance on his contemporaries—who took the wrong side, and
defended it by unfair means—who, the moment his own interest or
the prejudices of others interfered, seemed to forget all that was due
to the pride of intellect, to the sense of manhood—who, praised,
admired by men of all parties alike, repaid the public liberality by
striking a secret and envenomed blow at the reputation of every one
who was not the ready tool of power—who strewed the slime of
rankling malice and mercenary scorn over the bud and promise of
genius, because it was not fostered in the hot-bed of corruption, or
warped by the trammels of servility—who supported the worst abuses
of authority in the worst spirit—who joined a gang of desperadoes to
spread calumny, contempt, infamy, wherever they were merited by
honesty or talent on a different side—who officiously undertook to
decide public questions by private insinuations, to prop the throne by
nicknames, and the altar by lies—who being (by common consent),
the finest, the most humane and accomplished writer of his age,
associated himself with and encouraged the lowest panders of a venal
press; deluging, nauseating the public mind with the offal and
garbage of Billingsgate abuse and vulgar <em>slang</em>; showing no remorse,
no relenting or compassion towards the victims of this nefarious and
organized system of party-proscription, carried on under the mask of
literary criticism and fair discussion, insulting the misfortunes of
some, and trampling on the early grave of others—</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>LORD BYRON</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott are among writers now living<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
the two, who would carry away a majority of suffrages as the greatest
geniuses of the age. The former would, perhaps, obtain the preference
with the fine gentlemen and ladies (squeamishness apart)—the
latter with the critics and the vulgar. We shall treat of them in the
same connection, partly on account of their distinguished pre-eminence,
and partly because they afford a complete contrast to each other.
In their poetry, in their prose, in their politics, and in their tempers,
no two men can be more unlike.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Sir Walter Scott may be thought by some to have been</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Born universal heir to all humanity,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>it is plain Lord Byron can set up no such pretension. He is,
in a striking degree, the creature of his own will. He holds
no communion with his kind; but stands alone, without mate or
fellow—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As if a man were author of himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>And owned no other kin.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He is like a solitary peak, all access to which is cut off not more by
elevation than distance. He is seated on a lofty eminence, ‘cloud-capt,’
or reflecting the last rays of setting suns; and in his poetical
moods, reminds us of the fabled Titans, retired to a ridgy steep,
playing on their Pan’s-pipes, and taking up ordinary men and things
in their hands with haughty indifference. He raises his subject to
himself, or tramples on it; he neither stoops to, nor loses himself in
it. He exists not by sympathy, but by antipathy. He scorns all
things, even himself. Nature must come to him to sit for her
picture—he does not go to her. She must consult his time, his
convenience, and his humour; and wear a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sombre</span></i> or a fantastic garb,
or his Lordship turns his back upon her. There is no ease, no
unaffected simplicity of manner, no ‘golden mean.’ All is strained,
or petulant in the extreme. His thoughts are sphered and crystalline;
his style ‘prouder than when blue Iris bends’; his spirit fiery, impatient,
wayward, indefatigable. Instead of taking his impressions from without,
in entire and almost unimpaired masses, he moulds them according
to his own temperament, and heats the materials of his imagination
in the furnace of his passions.—Lord Byron’s verse glows like a
flame, consuming every thing in its way; Sir Walter Scott’s glides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>like a river, clear, gentle, harmless. The poetry of the first
scorches, that of the last scarcely warms. The light of the one
proceeds from an internal source, ensanguined, sullen, fixed; the
others reflects the hues of Heaven, or the face of nature, glancing
vivid and various. The productions of the Northern Bard have the
rust and the freshness of antiquity about them; those of the Noble
Poet cease to startle from their extreme ambition of novelty, both in
style and matter. Sir Walter’s rhymes are ‘silly sooth’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And dally with the innocence of thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the old age’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>his Lordship’s Muse spurns <em>the olden time</em>, and affects all the supercilious
airs of a modern fine lady and an upstart. The object of the
one writer is to restore us to truth and nature: the other chiefly
thinks how he shall display his own power, or vent his spleen, or
astonish the reader either by starting new subjects and trains of
speculation, or by expressing old ones in a more striking and emphatic
manner than they have been expressed before. He cares little what
it is he says, so that he can say it differently from others. This may
account for the charges of plagiarism which have been repeatedly
brought against the Noble Poet—if he can borrow an image or sentiment
from another, and heighten it by an epithet or an allusion of
greater force and beauty than is to be found in the original passage,
he thinks he shows his superiority of execution in this in a more
marked manner than if the first suggestion had been his own. It is
not the value of the observation itself he is solicitous about; but he
wishes to shine by contrast—even nature only serves as a foil to set
off his style. He therefore takes the thoughts of others (whether
contemporaries or not) out of their mouths, and is content to make
them his own, to set his stamp upon them, by imparting to them a
more meretricious gloss, a higher relief, a greater loftiness of tone,
and a characteristic inveteracy of purpose. Even in those collateral
ornaments of modern style, slovenliness, abruptness, and eccentricity
(as well as in terseness and significance), Lord Byron, when he
pleases, defies competition and surpasses all his contemporaries.
Whatever he does, he must do in a more decided and daring manner
than any one else—he lounges with extravagance, and yawns so as to
alarm the reader! Self-will, passion, the love of singularity, a disdain
of himself and of others (with a conscious sense that this is
among the ways and means of procuring admiration) are the proper
categories of his mind: he is a lordly writer, is above his own
reputation, and condescends to the Muses with a scornful grace!</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Byron, who in his politics is a <em>liberal</em>, in his genius is haughty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>and aristocratic: Walter Scott, who is an aristocrat in principle, is
popular in his writings, and is (as it were) equally <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">servile</span></i> to nature
and to opinion. The genius of Sir Walter is essentially imitative, or
‘denotes a foregone conclusion’: that of Lord Byron is self-dependent;
or at least requires no aid, is governed by no law, but
the impulses of its own will. We confess, however much we may
admire independence of feeling and erectness of spirit in general or
practical questions, yet in works of genius we prefer him who bows
to the authority of nature, who appeals to actual objects, to mouldering
superstitions, to history, observation, and tradition, before him
who only consults the pragmatical and restless workings of his own
breast, and gives them out as oracles to the world. We like a writer
(whether poet or prose-writer) who takes in (or is willing to take in)
the range of half the universe in feeling, character, description, much
better than we do one who obstinately and invariably shuts himself
up in the Bastile of his own ruling passions. In short, we had rather
be Sir Walter Scott (meaning thereby the Author of Waverley)
than Lord Byron, a hundred times over. And for the reason just
given, namely, that he casts his descriptions in the mould of nature,
ever-varying, never tiresome, always interesting and always instructive,
instead of casting them constantly in the mould of his own individual
impressions. He gives us man as he is, or as he was, in almost
every variety of situation, action, and feeling. Lord Byron makes
man after his own image, woman after his own heart; the one is a
capricious tyrant, the other a yielding slave; he gives us the misanthrope
and the voluptuary by turns; and with these two characters,
burning or melting in their own fires, he makes out everlasting centos
of himself. He hangs the cloud, the film of his existence over all
outward things—sits in the centre of his thoughts, and enjoys dark
night, bright day, the glitter and the gloom ‘in cell monastic’—we
see the mournful pall, the crucifix, the death’s heads, the faded
chaplet of flowers, the gleaming tapers, the agonized brow of genius,
the wasted form of beauty—but we are still imprisoned in a dungeon,
a curtain intercepts our view, we do not breathe freely the air of
nature or of our own thoughts—the other admired author draws aside
the curtain, and the veil of egotism is rent, and he shows us the
crowd of living men and women, the endless groups, the landscape
back-ground, the cloud and the rainbow, and enriches our imaginations
and relieves one passion by another, and expands and lightens
reflection, and takes away that tightness at the breast which arises
from thinking or wishing to think that there is nothing in the world
out of a man’s self!—In this point of view, the Author of Waverley
is one of the greatest teachers of morality that ever lived, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>emancipating the mind from petty, narrow, and bigotted prejudices:
Lord Byron is the greatest pamperer of those prejudices, by seeming
to think there is nothing else worth encouraging but the seeds or the
full luxuriant growth of dogmatism and self-conceit. In reading the
<cite>Scotch Novels</cite>, we never think about the author, except from a feeling
of curiosity respecting our unknown benefactor: in reading Lord
Byron’s works, he himself is never absent from our minds. The
colouring of Lord Byron’s style, however rich and dipped in Tyrian
dyes, is nevertheless opaque, is in itself an object of delight and
wonder: Sir Walter Scott’s is perfectly transparent. In studying
the one, you seem to gaze at the figures cut in stained glass, which
exclude the view beyond, and where the pure light of Heaven is only
a means of setting off the gorgeousness of art: in reading the other,
you look through a noble window at the clear and varied landscape
without. Or to sum up the distinction in one word, Sir Walter
Scott is the most <em>dramatic</em> writer now living; and Lord Byron is
the least so. It would be difficult to imagine that the Author of
Waverley is in the smallest degree a pedant; as it would be hard to
persuade ourselves that the author of Childe Harold and Don Juan is
not a coxcomb, though a provoking and sublime one. In this decided
preference given to Sir Walter Scott over Lord Byron, we distinctly
include the prose-works of the former; for we do not think his
poetry alone, by any means entitles him to that precedence. Sir
Walter in his poetry, though pleasing and natural, is a comparative
trifler: it is in his anonymous productions that he has shown himself
for what he is!—</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Intensity</em> is the great and prominent distinction of Lord Byron’s
writings. He seldom gets beyond force of style, nor has he produced
any regular work or masterly whole. He does not prepare any plan
beforehand, nor revise and retouch what he has written with polished
accuracy. His only object seems to be to stimulate himself and his
readers for the moment—to keep both alive, to drive away <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, to
substitute a feverish and irritable state of excitement for listless
indolence or even calm enjoyment. For this purpose he pitches on
any subject at random without much thought or delicacy—he is only
impatient to begin—and takes care to adorn and enrich it as he proceeds
with ‘thoughts that breathe and words that burn.’ He
composes (as he himself has said) whether he is in the bath, in his
study, or on horseback—he writes as habitually as others talk or
think—and whether we have the inspiration of the Muse or not, we
always find the spirit of the man of genius breathing from his verse.
He grapples with his subject, and moves, penetrates, and animates it
by the electric force of his own feelings. He is often monotonous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>extravagant, offensive; but he is never dull, or tedious, but when he
writes prose. Lord Byron does not exhibit a new view of nature, or
raise insignificant objects into importance by the romantic associations
with which he surrounds them; but generally (at least) takes common-place
thoughts and events, and endeavours to express them in stronger
and statelier language than others. His poetry stands like a Martello
tower by the side of his subject. He does not, like Mr. Wordsworth,
lift poetry from the ground, or create a sentiment out of
nothing. He does not describe a daisy or a periwinkle, but the
cedar or the cypress: not ‘poor men’s cottages, but princes’ palaces.’
His <cite>Childe Harold</cite> contains a lofty and impassioned review of the
great events of history, of the mighty objects left as wrecks of time,
but he dwells chiefly on what is familiar to the mind of every school-boy;
has brought out few new traits of feeling or thought; and has
done no more than justice to the reader’s preconceptions by the
sustained force and brilliancy of his style and imagery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Byron’s earlier productions, <cite>Lara</cite>, the <cite>Corsair</cite>, &amp;c. were
wild and gloomy romances, put into rapid and shining verse. They
discover the madness of poetry, together with the inspiration: sullen,
moody, capricious, fierce, inexorable, gloating on beauty, thirsting for
revenge, hurrying from the extremes of pleasure to pain, but with
nothing permanent, nothing healthy or natural. The gaudy decorations
and the morbid sentiments remind one of flowers strewed over
the face of death! In his <cite>Childe Harold</cite> (as has been just observed)
he assumes a lofty and philosophic tone, and ‘reasons high of providence,
fore-knowledge, will, and fate.’ He takes the highest points
in the history of the world, and comments on them from a more
commanding eminence: he shows us the crumbling monuments of
time, he invokes the great names, the mighty spirit of antiquity.
The universe is changed into a stately mausoleum:—in solemn
measures he chaunts a hymn to fame. Lord Byron has strength and
elevation enough to fill up the moulds of our classical and time-hallowed
recollections, and to rekindle the earliest aspirations of the
mind after greatness and true glory with a pen of fire. The names
of Tasso, of Ariosto, of Dante, of Cincinnatus, of Cæsar, of Scipio,
lose nothing of their pomp or their lustre in his hands, and when he
begins and continues a strain of panegyric on such subjects, we
indeed sit down with him to a banquet of rich praise, brooding over
imperishable glories,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Till Contemplation has her fill.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Lord Byron seems to cast himself indignantly from ‘this bank and
shoal of time,’ or the frail tottering bark that bears up modern reputation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>into the huge sea of ancient renown, and to revel there with
untired, outspread plume. Even this in him is spleen—his contempt
of his contemporaries makes him turn back to the lustrous past, or
project himself forward to the dim future!—Lord Byron’s tragedies,
Faliero,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Sardanapalus, &amp;c. are not equal to his other works. They
want the essence of the drama. They abound in speeches and
descriptions, such as he himself might make either to himself or
others, lolling on his couch of a morning, but do not carry the reader
out of the poet’s mind to the scenes and events recorded. They
have neither action, character, nor interest, but are a sort of <em>gossamer</em>
tragedies, spun out, and glittering, and spreading a flimsy veil over
the face of nature. Yet he spins them on. Of all that he has done
in this way the <cite>Heaven and Earth</cite> (the same subject as Mr. Moore’s
<cite>Loves of the Angels</cite>) is the best. We prefer it even to <cite>Manfred</cite>.
<cite>Manfred</cite> is merely himself, with a fancy-drapery on: but in the
dramatic fragment published in the <cite>Liberal</cite>, the space between Heaven
and Earth, the stage on which his characters have to pass to and fro,
seems to fill his Lordship’s imagination; and the Deluge, which he
has so finely described, may be said to have drowned all his own idle
humours.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must say we think little of our author’s turn for satire. His
‘English Bards and Scotch Reviewers’ is dogmatical and insolent,
but without refinement or point. He calls people names, and tries to
transfix a character with an epithet, which does not stick, because it
has no other foundation than his own petulance and spite; or he
endeavours to degrade by alluding to some circumstance of external
situation. He says of Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry, that ‘it is his
aversion.’ That may be: but whose fault is it? This is the satire
of a lord, who is accustomed to have all his whims or dislikes taken
for gospel, and who cannot be at the pains to do more than signify
his contempt or displeasure. If a great man meets with a rebuff
which he does not like, he turns on his heel, and this passes for a
repartee. The Noble Author says of a celebrated barrister and
critic, that he was ‘born in a garret sixteen stories high.’ The
insinuation is not true; or if it were, it is low. The allusion degrades
the person who makes, not him to whom it is applied. This is also
the satire of a person of birth and quality, who measures all merit by
external rank, that is, by his own standard. So his Lordship, in a
‘Letter to the Editor of My Grandmother’s Review,’ addresses him
fifty times as ‘<em>my dear Robarts</em>‘; nor is there any other wit in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>article. This is surely a mere assumption of superiority from his
Lordship’s rank, and is the sort of <em>quizzing</em> he might use to a person
who came to hire himself as a valet to him at <em>Long’s</em>—the waiters
might laugh, the public will not. In like manner, in the controversy
about Pope, he claps Mr. Bowles on the back with a coarse facetious
familiarity, as if he were his chaplain whom he had invited to dine
with him, or was about to present to a benefice. The reverend
divine might submit to the obligation, but he has no occasion to
subscribe to the jest. If it is a jest that Mr. Bowles should be a
parson, and Lord Byron a peer, the world knew this before; there
was no need to write a pamphlet to prove it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <cite>Don Juan</cite> indeed has great power; but its power is owing to
the force of the serious writing, and to the oddity of the contrast
between that and the flashy passages with which it is interlarded.
From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step. You laugh
and are surprised that any one should turn round and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travestie</span></i> himself:
the drollery is in the utter discontinuity of ideas and feelings.
He makes virtue serve as a foil to vice; <em>dandyism</em> is (for want of any
other) a variety of genius. A classical intoxication is followed by
the splashing of soda-water, by frothy effusions of ordinary bile.
After the lightning and the hurricane, we are introduced to the
interior of the cabin and the contents of wash-hand basins. The
solemn hero of tragedy plays <em>Scrub</em> in the farce. This is ‘very
tolerable and not to be endured.’ The Noble Lord is almost the
only writer who has prostituted his talents in this way. He hallows
in order to desecrate; takes a pleasure in defacing the images of
beauty his hands have wrought; and raises our hopes and our belief
in goodness to Heaven only to dash them to the earth again, and
break them in pieces the more effectually from the very height they
have fallen. Our enthusiasm for genius or virtue is thus turned into
a jest by the very person who has kindled it, and who thus fatally
quenches the sparks of both. It is not that Lord Byron is sometimes
serious and sometimes trifling, sometimes profligate, and sometimes
moral—but when he is most serious and most moral, he is only preparing
to mortify the unsuspecting reader by putting a pitiful <em>hoax</em>
upon him. This is a most unaccountable anomaly. It is as if the
eagle were to build its eyry in a common sewer, or the owl were seen
soaring to the mid-day sun. Such a sight might make one laugh, but
one would not wish or expect it to occur more than once.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In fact, Lord Byron is the spoiled child of fame as well as fortune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>He has taken a surfeit of popularity, and is not contented to delight,
unless he can shock the public. He would force them to admire in
spite of decency and common sense—he would have them read what
they would read in no one but himself, or he would not give a rush
for their applause. He is to be ‘a chartered libertine,’ from whom
insults are favours, whose contempt is to be a new incentive to
admiration. His Lordship is hard to please: he is equally averse to
notice or neglect, enraged at censure and scorning praise. He tries
the patience of the town to the very utmost, and when they show
signs of weariness or disgust, threatens to <em>discard</em> them. He says he
will write on, whether he is read or not. He would never write
another page, if it were not to court popular applause, or to affect a
superiority over it. In this respect also, Lord Byron presents a
striking contrast to Sir Walter Scott. The latter takes what part of
the public favour falls to his share, without grumbling (to be sure he
has no reason to complain); the former is always quarrelling with
the world about his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modicum</span></i> of applause, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">spolia opima</span></i> of vanity,
and ungraciously throwing the offerings of incense heaped on his
shrine back in the faces of his admirers. Again, there is no taint in
the writings of the Author of Waverley, all is fair and natural and
<em>above-board</em>: he never outrages the public mind. He introduces
no anomalous character: broaches no staggering opinion. If he goes
back to old prejudices and superstitions as a relief to the modern
reader, while Lord Byron floats on swelling paradoxes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like proud seas under him’;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>if the one defers too much to the spirit of antiquity, the other panders
to the spirit of the age, goes to the very edge of extreme and licentious
speculation, and breaks his neck over it. Grossness and levity are
the playthings of his pen. It is a ludicrous circumstance that he
should have dedicated his <em>Cain</em> to the worthy Baronet! Did the
latter ever acknowledge the obligation? We are not nice, not very
nice; but we do not particularly approve those subjects that shine
chiefly from their rottenness: nor do we wish to see the Muses drest
out in the flounces of a false or questionable philosophy, like <em>Portia</em>
and <em>Nerissa</em> in the garb of Doctors of Law. We like metaphysics
as well as Lord Byron; but not to see them making flowery speeches,
nor dancing a measure in the fetters of verse. We have as good as
hinted, that his Lordship’s poetry consists mostly of a tissue of superb
common-places; even his paradoxes are <em>common-place</em>. They are
familiar in the schools: they are only new and striking in his dramas
and stanzas, by being out of place. In a word, we think that poetry
moves best within the circle of nature and received opinion: speculative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>theory and subtle casuistry are forbidden ground to it. But
Lord Byron often wanders into this ground wantonly, wilfully, and
unwarrantably. The only apology we can conceive for the spirit of
some of Lord Byron’s writings, is the spirit of some of those opposed
to him. They would provoke a man to write anything. ‘Farthest
from them is best.’ The extravagance and license of the one seems
a proper antidote to the bigotry and narrowness of the other. The
first <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite> was a set-off to the second, though</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘None but itself could be its parallel.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the chief cause of most of Lord Byron’s errors is, that he
is that anomaly in letters and in society, a Noble Poet. It is a double
privilege, almost too much for humanity. He has all the pride of
birth and genius. The strength of his imagination leads him to
indulge in fantastic opinions; the elevation of his rank sets censure at
defiance. He becomes a pampered egotist. He has a seat in the
House of Lords, a niche in the Temple of Fame. Every-day
mortals, opinions, things are not good enough for him to touch or
think of. A mere nobleman is, in his estimation, but ‘the tenth
transmitter of a foolish face’: a mere man of genius is no better than
a worm. His Muse is also a lady of quality. The people are not
polite enough for him: the Court not sufficiently intellectual. He
hates the one and despises the other. By hating and despising
others, he does not learn to be satisfied with himself. A fastidious
man soon grows querulous and splenetic. If there is nobody but
ourselves to come up to our idea of fancied perfection, we easily get
tired of our idol. When a man is tired of what he is, by a natural
perversity he sets up for what he is not. If he is a poet, he pretends
to be a metaphysician: if he is a patrician in rank and feeling, he
would fain be one of the people. His ruling motive is not the love
of the people, but of distinction; not of truth, but of singularity.
He patronizes men of letters out of vanity, and deserts them from
caprice, or from the advice of friends. He embarks in an obnoxious
publication to provoke censure, and leaves it to shift for itself for fear
of scandal. We do not like Sir Walter’s gratuitous servility: we
like Lord Byron’s preposterous <em>liberalism</em> little better. He may affect
the principles of equality, but he resumes his privilege of peerage,
upon occasion. His Lordship has made great offers of service to the
Greeks—money and horses. He is at present in Cephalonia, waiting
the event!</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c011'>We had written thus far when news came of the death of Lord
Byron, and put an end at once to a strain of somewhat peevish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>invective, which was intended to meet his eye, not to insult his
memory. Had we known that we were writing his epitaph, we must
have done it with a different feeling. As it is, we think it better and
more like himself, to let what we had written stand, than to take up
our leaden shafts, and try to melt them into ‘tears of sensibility,’ or
mould them into dull praise, and an affected show of candour. We
were not silent during the author’s life-time, either for his reproof or
encouragement (such as we could give, and <em>he</em> did not disdain to
accept) nor can we now turn undertakers’ men to fix the glittering
plate upon his coffin, or fall into the procession of popular woe.—Death
cancels every thing but truth; and strips a man of every thing
but genius and virtue. It is a sort of natural canonization. It makes
the meanest of us sacred—it installs the poet in his immortality, and
lifts him to the skies. Death is the great assayer of the sterling ore
of talent. At his touch the drossy particles fall off, the irritable, the
personal, the gross, and mingle with the dust—the finer and more
ethereal part mounts with the winged spirit to watch over our latest
memory, and protect our bones from insult. We consign the least
worthy qualities to oblivion, and cherish the nobler and imperishable
nature with double pride and fondness. Nothing could show the real
superiority of genius in a more striking point of view than the idle
contests and the public indifference about the place of Lord Byron’s
interment, whether in Westminster Abbey or his own family-vault.
A king must have a coronation—a nobleman a funeral-procession.—The
man is nothing without the pageant. The poet’s cemetery is the
human mind, in which he sows the seeds of never-ending thought—his
monument is to be found in his works:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nothing can cover his high fame but Heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>No pyramids set off his memory,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the eternal substance of his greatness.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Lord Byron is dead: he also died a martyr to his zeal in the cause
of freedom, for the last, best hopes of man. Let that be his excuse
and his epitaph!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. SOUTHEY</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Southey, as we formerly remember to have seen him, had a
hectic flush upon his cheek, a roving fire in his eye, a falcon glance,
a look at once aspiring and dejected—it was the look that had been
impressed upon his face by the events that marked the outset of his
life, it was the dawn of Liberty that still tinged his cheek, a smile
betwixt hope and sadness that still played upon his quivering lip.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Mr. Southey’s mind is essentially sanguine, even to over-weeningness.
It is prophetic of good; it cordially embraces it; it casts a longing,
lingering look after it, even when it is gone for ever. He cannot
bear to give up the thought of happiness, his confidence in his fellow-man,
when all else despair. It is the very element, ‘where he must
live or have no life at all.’ While he supposed it possible that a
better form of society could be introduced than any that had hitherto
existed, while the light of the French Revolution beamed into his
soul (and long after, it was seen reflected on his brow, like the light
of setting suns on the peak of some high mountain, or lonely range of
clouds, floating in purer ether!) while he had this hope, this faith in
man left, he cherished it with child-like simplicity, he clung to it with
the fondness of a lover, he was an enthusiast, a fanatic, a leveller; he
stuck at nothing that he thought would banish all pain and misery
from the world—in his impatience of the smallest error or injustice,
he would have sacrificed himself and the existing generation (a
holocaust) to his devotion to the right cause. But when he once
believed after many staggering doubts and painful struggles, that this
was no longer possible, when his chimeras and golden dreams of
human perfectibility vanished from him, he turned suddenly round,
and maintained that ‘whatever <em>is</em>, is right.’ Mr. Southey has not
fortitude of mind, has not patience to think that evil is inseparable
from the nature of things. His irritable sense rejects the alternative
altogether, as a weak stomach rejects the food that is distasteful to it.
He hopes on against hope, he believes in all unbelief. He must
either repose on actual or on imaginary good. He missed his way in
<cite>Utopia</cite>, he has found it at Old Sarum—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His generous <em>ardour</em> no cold medium knows:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>his eagerness admits of no doubt or delay. He is ever in extremes,
and ever in the wrong!</p>

<p class='c011'>The reason is, that not truth, but self-opinion is the ruling principle
of Mr. Southey’s mind. The charm of novelty, the applause of the
multitude, the sanction of power, the venerableness of antiquity, pique,
resentment, the spirit of contradiction have a good deal to do with his
preferences. His inquiries are partial and hasty: his conclusions raw
and unconcocted, and with a considerable infusion of whim and humour
and a monkish spleen. His opinions are like certain wines, warm
and generous when new; but they will not keep, and soon turn flat
or sour, for want of a stronger spirit of the understanding to give a
body to them. He wooed Liberty as a youthful lover, but it was
perhaps more as a mistress than a bride; and he has since wedded
with an elderly and not very reputable lady, called Legitimacy. <em>A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>wilful man</em>, according to the Scotch proverb, <em>must have his way</em>. If
it were the cause to which he was sincerely attached, he would adhere
to it through good report and evil report; but it is himself to whom
he does homage, and would have others do so; and he therefore
changes sides, rather than submit to apparent defeat or temporary
mortification. Abstract principle has no rule but the understood
distinction between right and wrong; the indulgence of vanity, of
caprice, or prejudice is regulated by the convenience or bias of the
moment. The temperament of our politician’s mind is poetical, not
philosophical. He is more the creature of impulse, than he is of
reflection. He invents the unreal, he embellishes the false with the
glosses of fancy, but pays little attention to ‘the words of truth and
soberness.’ His impressions are accidental, immediate, personal,
instead of being permanent and universal. Of all mortals he is surely
the most impatient of contradiction, even when he has completely
turned the tables on himself. Is not this very inconsistency the
reason? Is he not tenacious of his opinions, in proportion as they
are brittle and hastily formed? Is he not jealous of the grounds of
his belief, because he fears they will not bear inspection, or is conscious
he has shifted them? Does he not confine others to the strict
line of orthodoxy, because he has himself taken every liberty? Is
he not afraid to look to the right or the left, lest he should see the
ghosts of his former extravagances staring him in the face? Does he
not refuse to tolerate the smallest shade of difference in others,
because he feels that he wants the utmost latitude of construction for
differing so widely from himself? Is he not captious, dogmatical,
petulant in delivering his sentiments, according as he has been inconsistent,
rash, and fanciful in adopting them? He maintains that there
can be no possible ground for differing from him, because he looks
only at his own side of the question! He sets up his own favourite
notions as the standard of reason and honesty, because he has changed
from one extreme to another! He treats his opponents with
contempt, because he is himself afraid of meeting with disrespect!
He says that ‘a Reformer is a worse character than a house-breaker,’
in order to stifle the recollection that he himself once was one!</p>

<p class='c011'>We must say that ‘we relish Mr. Southey more in the Reformer’
than in his lately acquired, but by no means natural or becoming
character of poet-laureat and courtier. He may rest assured that a
garland of wild flowers suits him better than the laureat-wreath:
that his pastoral odes and popular inscriptions were far more adapted
to his genius than his presentation-poems. He is nothing akin to
birth-day suits and drawing-room fopperies. ‘He is nothing, if not
fantastical.’ In his figure, in his movements, in his sentiments, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>is sharp and angular, quaint and eccentric. Mr. Southey is not of
the court, courtly. Every thing of him and about him is from the
people. He is not classical, he is not legitimate. He is not a man
cast in the mould of other men’s opinions: he is not shaped on any
model: he bows to no authority: he yields only to his own wayward
peculiarities. He is wild, irregular, singular, extreme. He is no
formalist, not he! All is crude and chaotic, self-opinionated, vain.
He wants proportion, keeping, system, standard rules. He is not
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">teres et rotundus</span></i>. Mr. Southey walks with his chin erect through
the streets of London, and with an umbrella sticking out under his
arm, in the finest weather. He has not sacrificed to the Graces,
nor studied decorum. With him every thing is projecting, starting
from its place, an episode, a digression, a poetic license. He does
not move in any given orbit, but like a falling star, shoots from his
sphere. He is pragmatical, restless, unfixed, full of experiments,
beginning every thing anew, wiser than his betters, judging for
himself, dictating to others. He is decidedly <em>revolutionary</em>. He
may have given up the reform of the State: but depend upon it, he
has some other <em>hobby</em> of the same kind. Does he not dedicate to his
present Majesty that extraordinary poem on the death of his father,
called <cite>The Vision of Judgment</cite>, as a specimen of what might be done
in English hexameters? In a court-poem all should be trite and on
an approved model. He might as well have presented himself at the
levee in a fancy or masquerade dress. Mr. Southey was not <em>to try
conclusions</em> with Majesty—still less on such an occasion. The
extreme freedoms with departed greatness, the party-petulance carried
to the Throne of Grace, the unchecked indulgence of private humour,
the assumption of infallibility and even of the voice of Heaven in
this poem, are pointed instances of what we have said. They show
the singular state of over-excitement of Mr. Southey’s mind, and the
force of old habits of independent and unbridled thinking, which
cannot be kept down even in addressing his Sovereign! Look at
Mr. Southey’s larger poems, his <cite>Kehama</cite>, his <cite>Thalaba</cite>, his <cite>Madoc</cite>,
his <cite>Roderic</cite>. Who will deny the spirit, the scope, the splendid
imagery, the hurried and startling interest that pervades them? Who
will say that they are not sustained on fictions wilder than his own
Glendoveer, that they are not the daring creations of a mind curbed
by no law, tamed by no fear, that they are not rather like the
trances than the waking dreams of genius, that they are not the very
paradoxes of poetry? All this is very well, very intelligible, and
very harmless, if we regard the rank excrescences of Mr. Southey’s
poetry, like the red and blue flowers in corn, as the unweeded growth
of a luxuriant and wandering fancy; or if we allow the yeasty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>workings of an ardent spirit to ferment and boil over—the variety, the
boldness, the lively stimulus given to the mind may then atone for the
violation of rules and the offences to bed-rid authority; but not if our
poetic libertine sets up for a law-giver and judge, or an apprehender
of vagrants in the regions either of taste or opinion. Our motley
gentleman deserves the strait-waistcoat, if he is for setting others in
the stocks of servility, or condemning them to the pillory for a new
mode of rhyme or reason. Or if a composer of sacred Dramas on
classic models, or a translator of an old Latin author (that will
hardly bear translation) or a vamper-up of vapid cantos and Odes set
to music, were to turn pander to prescription and palliator of every
dull, incorrigible abuse, it would not be much to be wondered at or
even regretted. But in Mr. Southey it was a lamentable falling-off.
It is indeed to be deplored, it is a stain on genius, a blow to humanity,
that the author of <cite>Joan of Arc</cite>—that work in which the love of
Liberty is exhaled like the breath of spring, mild, balmy, heavenborn,
that is full of tears and virgin-sighs, and yearnings of affection
after truth and good, gushing warm and crimsoned from the heart—should
ever after turn to folly, or become the advocate of a rotten
cause. After giving up his heart to that subject, he ought not
(whatever others might do) ever to have set his foot within the
threshold of a court. He might be sure that he would not gain
forgiveness or favour by it, nor obtain a single cordial smile from
greatness. All that Mr. Southey is or that he does best, is independent,
spontaneous, free as the vital air he draws—when he affects
the courtier or the sophist, he is obliged to put a constraint upon
himself, to hold in his breath, he loses his genius, and offers a
violence to his nature. His characteristic faults are the excess of
a lively, unguarded temperament:—oh! let them not degenerate
into cold-blooded, heartless vices! If we speak or have ever spoken
of Mr. Southey with severity, it is with ‘the malice of old friends,’
for we count ourselves among his sincerest and heartiest well-wishers.
But while he himself is anomalous, incalculable, eccentric, from
youth to age (the <cite>Wat Tyler</cite> and the <cite>Vision of Judgment</cite> are the
Alpha and Omega of his disjointed career) full of sallies of humour,
of ebullitions of spleen, making <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jets-a’eaux</span></i>, cascades, fountains, and
water-works of his idle opinions, he would shut up the wits of
others in leaden cisterns, to stagnate and corrupt, or bury them
under ground—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Far from the sun and summer gale!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He would suppress the freedom of wit and humour, of which he has
set the example, and claim a privilege for playing antics. He would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>introduce an uniformity of intellectual weights and measures, of
irregular metres and settled opinions, and enforce it with a high
hand. This has been judged hard by some, and has brought down
a severity of recrimination, perhaps disproportioned to the injury
done. ‘Because he is virtuous,’ (it has been asked,) ‘are there to
be no more cakes and ale?’ Because he is loyal, are we to take
all our notions from the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>? Because he is orthodox,
are we to do nothing but read the <cite>Book of the Church</cite>? We declare
we think his former poetical scepticism was not only more amiable,
but had more of the spirit of religion in it, implied a more heartfelt
trust in nature and providence than his present bigotry. We are
at the same time free to declare that we think his articles in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, notwithstanding their virulence and the talent
they display, have a tendency to qualify its most pernicious effects.
They have redeeming traits in them. ‘A little leaven leaveneth
the whole lump’; and the spirit of humanity (thanks to Mr. Southey)
is not quite expelled from the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>. At the corner of
his pen, ‘there hangs a vapourous drop profound’ of independence
and liberality, which falls upon its pages, and oozes out through the
pores of the public mind. There is a fortunate difference between
writers whose hearts are naturally callous to truth, and whose understandings
are hermetically sealed against all impressions but those of
self-interest, and a man like Mr. Southey. <em>Once a philanthropist and
always a philanthropist.</em> No man can entirely baulk his nature: it
breaks out in spite of him. In all those questions, where the spirit
of contradiction does not interfere, on which he is not sore from old
bruises, or sick from the extravagance of youthful intoxication, as
from a last night’s debauch, our ‘laureate’ is still bold, free, candid,
open to conviction, a reformist without knowing it. He does not
advocate the slave-trade, he does not arm Mr. Malthus’s revolting
ratios with his authority, he does not strain hard to deluge Ireland
with blood. On such points, where humanity has not become
obnoxious, where liberty has not passed into a by-word, Mr.
Southey is still liberal and humane. The elasticity of his spirit is
unbroken: the bow recoils to its old position. He still stands
convicted of his early passion for inquiry and improvement. He
was not regularly articled as a Government-tool!—Perhaps the
most pleasing and striking of all Mr. Southey’s poems are not his
triumphant taunts hurled against oppression, are not his glowing
effusions to Liberty, but those in which, with a mild melancholy,
he seems conscious of his own infirmities of temper, and to feel a
wish to correct by thought and time the precocity and sharpness of
his disposition. May the quaint but affecting aspiration expressed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>one of these be fulfilled, that as he mellows into maturer age, all such
asperities may wear off, and he himself become</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like the high leaves upon the holly-tree!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Southey’s prose-style can scarcely be too much praised. It is
plain, clear, pointed, familiar, perfectly modern in its texture, but with
a grave and sparkling admixture of <em>archaisms</em> in its ornaments and
occasional phraseology. He is the best and most natural prose-writer
of any poet of the day; we mean that he is far better than
Lord Byron, Mr. Wordsworth, or Mr. Coleridge, for instance.
The manner is perhaps superior to the matter, that is, in his Essays
and Reviews. There is rather a want of originality and even of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">impetus</span></i>: but there is no want of playful or biting satire, of ingenuity,
of casuistry, of learning and of information. He is ‘full of wise
saws and modern’ (as well as ancient) ‘instances.’ Mr. Southey
may not always convince his opponents; but he seldom fails to
stagger, never to gall them. In a word, we may describe his style
by saying that it has not the body or thickness of port wine, but is
like clear sherry with kernels of old authors thrown into it!—He
also excels as an historian and prose-translator. His histories abound
in information, and exhibit proofs of the most indefatigable patience
and industry. By no uncommon process of the mind, Mr. Southey
seems willing to steady the extreme levity of his opinions and feelings
by an appeal to facts. His translations of the Spanish and French
romances are also executed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">con amore</span></i>, and with the literal fidelity
and care of a mere linguist. That of the <cite>Cid</cite>, in particular, is a
masterpiece. Not a word could be altered for the better, in the old
scriptural style which it adopts in conformity to the original. It is no
less interesting in itself, or as a record of high and chivalrous feelings
and manners, than it is worthy of perusal as a literary curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Southey’s conversation has a little resemblance to a common-place
book; his habitual deportment to a piece of clock-work. He
is not remarkable either as a reasoner or an observer: but he is
quick, unaffected, replete with anecdote, various and retentive in his
reading, and exceedingly happy in his play upon words, as most
scholars are who give their minds this sportive turn. We have
chiefly seen Mr. Southey in company where few people appear to
advantage, we mean in that of Mr. Coleridge. He has not certainly
the same range of speculation, nor the same flow of sounding words,
but he makes up by the details of knowledge, and by a scrupulous
correctness of statement for what he wants in originality of thought,
or impetuous declamation. The tones of Mr. Coleridge’s voice
are eloquence: those of Mr. Southey are meagre, shrill, and dry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Mr. Coleridge’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is conversation, and he is conscious of this:
Mr. Southey evidently considers writing as his stronghold, and if
gravelled in an argument, or at a loss for an explanation, refers to
something he has written on the subject, or brings out his port-folio,
doubled down in dog-ears, in confirmation of some fact. He is
scholastic and professional in his ideas. He sets more value on
what he writes than on what he says: he is perhaps prouder of his
library than of his own productions—themselves a library! He is
more simple in his manners than his friend Mr. Coleridge; but at
the same time less cordial or conciliating. He is less vain, or has
less hope of pleasing, and therefore lays himself less out to please.
There is an air of condescension in his civility. With a tall, loose
figure, a peaked austerity of countenance, and no inclination to
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i>, you would say he has something puritanical, something
ascetic in his appearance. He answers to Mandeville’s description
of Addison, ‘a parson in a tye-wig.’ He is not a boon companion,
nor does he indulge in the pleasures of the table, nor in any other
vice; nor are we aware that Mr. Southey is chargeable with any
human frailty but—<em>want of charity</em>! Having fewer errors to plead
guilty to, he is less lenient to those of others. He was born an age
too late. Had he lived a century or two ago, he would have been
a happy as well as blameless character. But the distraction of the
time has unsettled him, and the multiplicity of his pretensions have
jostled with each other. No man in our day (at least no man of
genius) has led so uniformly and entirely the life of a scholar from
boyhood to the present hour, devoting himself to learning with the
enthusiasm of an early love, with the severity and constancy of a
religious vow—and well would it have been for him if he had
confined himself to this, and not undertaken to pull down or to
patch up the State! However irregular in his opinions, Mr.
Southey is constant, unremitting, mechanical in his studies, and
the performance of his duties. There is nothing Pindaric or
Shandean here. In all the relations and charities of private life,
he is correct, exemplary, generous, just. We never heard a single
impropriety laid to his charge; and if he has many enemies, few
men can boast more numerous or stauncher friends.—The variety
and piquancy of his writings form a striking contrast to the mode
in which they are produced. He rises early, and writes or reads
till breakfast-time. He writes or reads after breakfast till dinner,
after dinner till tea, and from tea till bed-time—</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>on Derwent’s banks, beneath the foot of Skiddaw. Study serves
him for business, exercise, recreation. He passes from verse to
prose, from history to poetry, from reading to writing, by a stopwatch.
He writes a fair hand, without blots, sitting upright in his
chair, leaves off when he comes to the bottom of the page, and
changes the subject for another, as opposite as the Antipodes. His
mind is after all rather the recipient and transmitter of knowledge,
than the originator of it. He has hardly grasp of thought enough
to arrive at any great leading truth. His passions do not amount to
more than irritability. With some gall in his pen, and coldness in
his manner, he has a great deal of kindness in his heart. Rash in
his opinions, he is steady in his attachments—and is a man, in many
particulars admirable, in all respectable—his political inconsistency
alone excepted!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. WORDSWORTH</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Wordsworth’s genius is a pure emanation of the Spirit of
the Age. Had he lived in any other period of the world, he would
never have been heard of. As it is, he has some difficulty to contend
with the hebetude of his intellect, and the meanness of his subject.
With him ‘lowliness is young ambition’s ladder’: but he finds it a
toil to climb in this way the steep of Fame. His homely Muse
can hardly raise her wing from the ground, nor spread her hidden
glories to the sun. He has ‘no figures nor no fantasies, which busy
<em>passion</em> draws in the brains of men:’ neither the gorgeous machinery
of mythologic lore, nor the splendid colours of poetic diction. His
style is vernacular: he delivers household truths. He sees nothing
loftier than human hopes; nothing deeper than the human heart.
This he probes, this he tampers with, this he poises, with all its
incalculable weight of thought and feeling, in his hands; and at the
same time calms the throbbing pulses of his own heart, by keeping
his eye ever fixed on the face of nature. If he can make the lifeblood
flow from the wounded breast, this is the living colouring with
which he paints his verse: if he can assuage the pain or close up
the wound with the balm of solitary musing, or the healing power
of plants and herbs and ‘skyey influences,’ this is the sole triumph
of his art. He takes the simplest elements of nature and of the
human mind, the mere abstract conditions inseparable from our
being, and tries to compound a new system of poetry from them;
and has perhaps succeeded as well as any one could. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil humani
a me alienum puto</span></i>’—is the motto of his works. He thinks nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>low or indifferent of which this can be affirmed: every thing that
professes to be more than this, that is not an absolute essence of
truth and feeling, he holds to be vitiated, false, and spurious. In a
word, his poetry is founded on setting up an opposition (and pushing
it to the utmost length) between the natural and the artificial;
between the spirit of humanity, and the spirit of fashion and of
the world!</p>

<p class='c011'>It is one of the innovations of the time. It partakes of, and is
carried along with, the revolutionary movement of our age: the
political changes of the day were the model on which he formed
and conducted his poetical experiments. His Muse (it cannot be
denied, and without this we cannot explain its character at all) is
a levelling one. It proceeds on a principle of equality, and strives
to reduce all things to the same standard. It is distinguished by a
proud humility. It relies upon its own resources, and disdains external
show and relief. It takes the commonest events and objects, as a
test to prove that nature is always interesting from its inherent truth
and beauty, without any of the ornaments of dress or pomp of
circumstances to set it off. Hence the unaccountable mixture of
seeming simplicity and real abstruseness in the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>.
Fools have laughed at, wise men scarcely understand them. He
takes a subject or a story merely as pegs or loops to hang thought
and feeling on; the incidents are trifling, in proportion to his contempt
for imposing appearances; the reflections are profound,
according to the gravity and the aspiring pretensions of his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>His popular, inartificial style gets rid (at a blow) of all the
trappings of verse, of all the high places of poetry: ‘the cloud-capt
towers, the solemn temples, the gorgeous palaces,’ are swept to the
ground, and ‘like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck
behind.’ All the traditions of learning, all the superstitions of age,
are obliterated and effaced. We begin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</span></i>, on a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i> of
poetry. The purple pall, the nodding plume of tragedy are
exploded as mere pantomime and trick, to return to the simplicity of
truth and nature. Kings, queens, priests, nobles, the altar and the
throne, the distinctions of rank, birth, wealth, power, ‘the judge’s
robe, the marshal’s truncheon, the ceremony that to great ones ‘longs,’
are not to be found here. The author tramples on the pride of art
with greater pride. The Ode and Epode, the Strophe and the
Antistrophe, he laughs to scorn. The harp of Homer, the trump of
Pindar and of Alcæus are still. The decencies of costume, the decorations
of vanity are stripped off without mercy as barbarous, idle, and
Gothic. The jewels in the crisped hair, the diadem on the polished
brow are thought meretricious, theatrical, vulgar; and nothing contents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>his fastidious taste beyond a simple garland of flowers. Neither
does he avail himself of the advantages which nature or accident holds
out to him. He chooses to have his subject a foil to his invention,
to owe nothing but to himself. He gathers manna in the wilderness,
he strikes the barren rock for the gushing moisture. He elevates
the mean by the strength of his own aspirations; he clothes the
naked with beauty and grandeur from the stores of his own recollections.
No cypress grove loads his verse with funeral pomp: but his
imagination lends ‘a sense of joy</p>

<p class='c015'>No storm, no shipwreck startles us by its horrors: but the rainbow
lifts its head in the cloud, and the breeze sighs through the withered
fern. No sad vicissitude of fate, no overwhelming catastrophe in
nature deforms his page: but the dew-drop glitters on the bending
flower, the tear collects in the glistening eye.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the lark ascends from its low bed on fluttering wing, and salutes
the morning skies; so Mr. Wordsworth’s unpretending Muse, in
russet guise, scales the summits of reflection, while it makes the round
earth its footstool, and its home!</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly a good deal of this may be regarded as the effect of
disappointed views and an inverted ambition. Prevented by native
pride and indolence from climbing the ascent of learning or greatness,
taught by political opinions to say to the vain pomp and glory of the
world, ‘I hate ye,’ seeing the path of classical and artificial poetry
blocked up by the cumbrous ornaments of style and turgid <em>common-places</em>,
so that nothing more could be achieved in that direction but
by the most ridiculous bombast or the tamest servility; he has turned
back partly from the bias of his mind, partly perhaps from a judicious
policy—has struck into the sequestered vale of humble life, sought
out the Muse among sheep-cotes and hamlets and the peasant’s
mountain-haunts, has discarded all the tinsel pageantry of verse, and
endeavoured (not in vain) to aggrandise the trivial and add the charm
of novelty to the familiar. No one has shown the same imagination
in raising trifles into importance: no one has displayed the same
pathos in treating of the simplest feelings of the heart. Reserved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>yet haughty, having no unruly or violent passions, (or those passions
having been early suppressed,) Mr. Wordsworth has passed his life
in solitary musing, or in daily converse with the face of nature. He
exemplifies in an eminent degree the power of <em>association</em>; for his
poetry has no other source or character. He has dwelt among
pastoral scenes, till each object has become connected with a thousand
feelings, a link in the chain of thought, a fibre of his own heart.
Every one is by habit and familiarity strongly attached to the place
of his birth, or to objects that recal the most pleasing and eventful
circumstances of his life. But to the author of the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>,
nature is a kind of home; and he may be said to take a personal
interest in the universe. There is no image so insignificant that it has
not in some mood or other found the way into his heart: no sound
that does not awaken the memory of other years.—</p>

      <div class='line'>Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The daisy looks up to him with sparkling eye as an old acquaintance:
the cuckoo haunts him with sounds of early youth not to be
expressed: a linnet’s nest startles him with boyish delight: an old
withered thorn is weighed down with a heap of recollections: a grey
cloak, seen on some wild moor, torn by the wind, or drenched in the
rain, afterwards becomes an object of imagination to him: even the
lichens on the rock have a life and being in his thoughts. He has
described all these objects in a way and with an intensity of feeling that
no one else had done before him, and has given a new view or aspect of
nature. He is in this sense the most original poet now living, and
the one whose writings could the least be spared: for they have no
substitute elsewhere. The vulgar do not read them, the learned,
who see all things through books, do not understand them, the great
despise, the fashionable may ridicule them: but the author has
created himself an interest in the heart of the retired and lonely
student of nature, which can never die. Persons of this class
will still continue to feel what he has felt: he has expressed what
they might in vain wish to express, except with glistening eye and
faultering tongue! There is a lofty philosophic tone, a thoughtful
humanity, infused into his pastoral vein. Remote from the passions
and events of the great world, he has communicated interest and
dignity to the primal movements of the heart of man, and ingrafted
his own conscious reflections on the casual thoughts of hinds and
shepherds. Nursed amidst the grandeur of mountain scenery, he has
stooped to have a nearer view of the daisy under his feet, or plucked a
branch of white-thorn from the spray: but in describing it, his mind seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>imbued with the majesty and solemnity of the objects around him—the
tall rock lifts its head in the erectness of his spirit; the cataract
roars in the sound of his verse; and in its dim and mysterious meaning,
the mists seem to gather in the hollows of Helvellyn, and the
forked Skiddaw hovers in the distance. There is little mention of
mountainous scenery in Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry; but by internal
evidence one might be almost sure that it was written in a mountainous
country, from its bareness, its simplicity, its loftiness and its
depth!</p>

<p class='c011'>His later philosophic productions have a somewhat different
character. They are a departure from, a dereliction of his first
principles. They are classical and courtly. They are polished in
style, without being gaudy; dignified in subject, without affectation.
They seem to have been composed not in a cottage at Grasmere, but
among the half-inspired groves and stately recollections of Cole-Orton.
We might allude in particular, for examples of what we
mean, to the lines on a Picture by Claude Lorraine, and to the
exquisite poem, entitled <cite>Laodamia</cite>. The last of these breathes the
pure spirit of the finest fragments of antiquity—the sweetness, the
gravity, the strength, the beauty and the languor of death—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Calm contemplation and majestic pains.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Its glossy brilliancy arises from the perfection of the finishing, like that
of careful sculpture, not from gaudy colouring—the texture of the
thoughts has the smoothness and solidity of marble. It is a poem
that might be read aloud in Elysium, and the spirits of departed
heroes and sages would gather round to listen to it! Mr. Wordsworth’s
philosophic poetry, with a less glowing aspect and less
tumult in the veins than Lord Byron’s on similar occasions, bends a
calmer and keener eye on mortality; the impression, if less vivid, is
more pleasing and permanent; and we confess it (perhaps it is a want
of taste and proper feeling) that there are lines and poems of our
author’s, that we think of ten times for once that we recur to any of
Lord Byron’s. Or if there are any of the latter’s writings, that we
can dwell upon in the same way, that is, as lasting and heartfelt
sentiments, it is when laying aside his usual pomp and pretension, he
descends with Mr. Wordsworth to the common ground of a disinterested
humanity. It may be considered as characteristic of our
poet’s writings, that they either make no impression on the mind at
all, seem mere <em>nonsense-verses</em>, or that they leave a mark behind them
that never wears out. They either</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Fall blunted from the indurated breast’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>without any perceptible result, or they absorb it like a passion. To
one class of readers he appears sublime, to another (and we fear
the largest) ridiculous. He has probably realised Milton’s wish,—‘and
fit audience found, though few’; but we suspect he is not
reconciled to the alternative. There are delightful passages in the
<span class='sc'>Excursion</span>, both of natural description and of inspired reflection
(passages of the latter kind that in the sound of the thoughts and
of the swelling language resemble heavenly symphonies, mournful
<em>requiems</em> over the grave of human hopes); but we must add, in
justice and in sincerity, that we think it impossible that this work
should ever become popular, even in the same degree as the <cite>Lyrical
Ballads</cite>. It affects a system without having any intelligible clue
to one; and instead of unfolding a principle in various and striking
lights, repeats the same conclusions till they become flat and insipid.
Mr. Wordsworth’s mind is obtuse, except as it is the
organ and the receptacle of accumulated feelings: it is not analytic, but
synthetic; it is reflecting, rather than theoretical. The <span class='sc'>Excursion</span>,
we believe, fell still-born from the press. There was something
abortive, and clumsy, and ill-judged in the attempt. It was long
and laboured. The personages, for the most part, were low, the
fare rustic: the plan raised expectations which were not fulfilled,
and the effect was like being ushered into a stately hall and invited
to sit down to a splendid banquet in the company of clowns, and
with nothing but successive courses of apple-dumplings served up.
It was not even <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toujours perdrix</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Wordsworth, in his person, is above the middle size, with
marked features, and an air somewhat stately and Quixotic. He
reminds one of some of Holbein’s heads, grave, saturnine, with a
slight indication of sly humour, kept under by the manners of the age
or by the pretensions of the person. He has a peculiar sweetness in
his smile, and great depth and manliness and a rugged harmony, in
the tones of his voice. His manner of reading his own poetry is
particularly imposing; and in his favourite passages his eye beams
with preternatural lustre, and the meaning labours slowly up from his
swelling breast. No one who has seen him at these moments could
go away with an impression that he was a ‘man of no mark or likelihood.’
Perhaps the comment of his face and voice is necessary to
convey a full idea of his poetry. His language may not be intelligible,
but his manner is not to be mistaken. It is clear that he is either
mad or inspired. In company, even in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>, Mr. Wordsworth
is often silent, indolent, and reserved. If he is become verbose and
oracular of late years, he was not so in his better days. He threw
out a bold or an indifferent remark without either effort or pretension,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>and relapsed into musing again. He shone most (because he seemed
most roused and animated) in reciting his own poetry, or in talking
about it. He sometimes gave striking views of his feelings and trains
of association in composing certain passages; or if one did not always
understand his distinctions, still there was no want of interest—there
was a latent meaning worth inquiring into, like a vein of ore that one
cannot exactly hit upon at the moment, but of which there are sure
indications. His standard of poetry is high and severe, almost to
exclusiveness. He admits of nothing below, scarcely of any thing
above himself. It is fine to hear him talk of the way in which
certain subjects should have been treated by eminent poets, according
to his notions of the art. Thus he finds fault with Dryden’s description
of Bacchus in the <cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite>, as if he were a mere
good-looking youth, or boon companion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Flushed with a purple grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>He shows his honest face’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>instead of representing the God returning from the conquest of India,
crowned with vine-leaves, and drawn by panthers, and followed by
troops of satyrs, of wild men and animals that he had tamed. You
would think, in hearing him speak on this subject, that you saw
Titian’s picture of the meeting of <cite>Bacchus and Ariadne</cite>—so classic
were his conceptions, so glowing his style. Milton is his great idol,
and he sometimes dares to compare himself with him. His Sonnets,
indeed, have something of the same high-raised tone and prophetic
spirit. Chaucer is another prime favourite of his, and he has been
at the pains to modernize some of the Canterbury Tales. Those
persons who look upon Mr. Wordsworth as a merely puerile writer,
must be rather at a loss to account for his strong predilection for such
geniuses as Dante and Michael Angelo. We do not think our author
has any very cordial sympathy with Shakespear. How should he?
Shakespear was the least of an egotist of any body in the world.
He does not much relish the variety and scope of dramatic composition.
‘He hates those interlocutions between Lucius and Caius.’
Yet Mr. Wordsworth himself wrote a tragedy when he was young;
and we have heard the following energetic lines quoted from it, as
put into the mouth of a person smit with remorse for some rash
crime:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Action is momentary,</div>
      <div class='line'>The motion of a muscle this way or that;</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffering is long, obscure, and infinite!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps for want of light and shade, and the unshackled spirit of the
drama, this performance was never brought forward. Our critic has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>a great dislike to Gray, and a fondness for Thomson and Collins.
It is mortifying to hear him speak of Pope and Dryden, whom,
because they have been supposed to have all the possible excellences
of poetry, he will allow to have none. Nothing, however, can be
fairer, or more amusing, than the way in which he sometimes exposes
the unmeaning verbiage of modern poetry. Thus, in the beginning
of Dr. Johnson’s <cite>Vanity of Human Wishes</cite>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let observation with extensive view</div>
      <div class='line'>Survey mankind from China to Peru’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>he says there is a total want of imagination accompanying the words,
the same idea is repeated three times under the disguise of a different
phraseology: it comes to this—‘let <em>observation</em>, with extensive
<em>observation</em>, <em>observe</em> mankind’; or take away the first line, and the
second,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Survey mankind from China to Peru,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>literally conveys the whole. Mr. Wordsworth is, we must say, a
perfect Drawcansir as to prose writers. He complains of the dry
reasoners and matter-of-fact people for their want of <em>passion</em>; and he
is jealous of the rhetorical declaimers and rhapsodists as trenching on
the province of poetry. He condemns all French writers (as well of
poetry as prose) in the lump. His list in this way is indeed small.
He approves of Walton’s Angler, Paley, and some other writers of
an inoffensive modesty of pretension. He also likes books of voyages
and travels, and Robinson Crusoe. In art, he greatly esteems
Bewick’s woodcuts, and Waterloo’s sylvan etchings. But he sometimes
takes a higher tone, and gives his mind fair play. We have
known him enlarge with a noble intelligence and enthusiasm on
Nicolas Poussin’s fine landscape-compositions, pointing out the unity
of design that pervades them, the superintending mind, the imaginative
principle that brings all to bear on the same end; and declaring he
would not give a rush for any landscape that did not express the time
of day, the climate, the period of the world it was meant to illustrate,
or had not this character of <em>wholeness</em> in it. His eye also does justice
to Rembrandt’s fine and masterly effects. In the way in which that
artist works something out of nothing, and transforms the stump of a
tree, a common figure into an <em>ideal</em> object, by the gorgeous light and
shade thrown upon it, he perceives an analogy to his own mode of
investing the minute details of nature with an atmosphere of sentiment;
and in pronouncing Rembrandt to be a man of genius, feels that he
strengthens his own claim to the title. It has been said of Mr.
Wordsworth, that ‘he hates conchology, that he hates the Venus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Medicis.’ But these, we hope, are mere epigrams and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux-d’esprit</span></i>,
as far from truth as they are free from malice; a sort of running satire
or critical clenches—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where one for sense and one for rhyme</div>
      <div class='line'>Is quite sufficient at one time.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>We think, however, that if Mr. Wordsworth had been a more liberal
and candid critic, he would have been a more sterling writer. If a
greater number of sources of pleasure had been open to him, he would
have communicated pleasure to the world more frequently. Had he
been less fastidious in pronouncing sentence on the works of others,
his own would have been received more favourably, and treated more
leniently. The current of his feelings is deep, but narrow; the
range of his understanding is lofty and aspiring rather than discursive.
The force, the originality, the absolute truth and identity with which
he feels some things, makes him indifferent to so many others. The
simplicity and enthusiasm of his feelings, with respect to nature,
renders him bigotted and intolerant in his judgments of men and
things. But it happens to him, as to others, that his strength lies in
his weakness; and perhaps we have no right to complain. We might
get rid of the cynic and the egotist, and find in his stead a common-place
man. We should ‘take the good the Gods provide us’: a fine
and original vein of poetry is not one of their most contemptible gifts,
and the rest is scarcely worth thinking of, except as it may be a
mortification to those who expect perfection from human nature; or
who have been idle enough at some period of their lives, to deify
men of genius as possessing claims above it. But this is a chord that
jars, and we shall not dwell upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Byron we have called, according to the old proverb, ‘the
spoiled child of fortune’: Mr. Wordsworth might plead, in mitigation
of some peculiarities, that he is ‘the spoiled child of disappointment.’
We are convinced, if he had been early a popular poet, he would
have borne his honours meekly, and would have been a person of
great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i> and frankness of disposition. But the sense of
injustice and of undeserved ridicule sours the temper and narrows the
views. To have produced works of genius, and to find them
neglected or treated with scorn, is one of the heaviest trials of human
patience. We exaggerate our own merits when they are denied by
others, and are apt to grudge and cavil at every particle of praise
bestowed on those to whom we feel a conscious superiority. In mere
self-defence we turn against the world, when it turns against us;
brood over the undeserved slights we receive; and thus the genial
current of the soul is stopped, or vents itself in effusions of petulance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and self-conceit. Mr. Wordsworth has thought too much of contemporary
critics and criticism; and less than he ought of the award
of posterity, and of the opinion, we do not say of private friends, but
of those who were made so by their admiration of his genius. He
did not court popularity by a conformity to established models, and
he ought not to have been surprised that his originality was not
understood as a matter of course. He has <em>gnawed too much on the
bridle</em>; and has often thrown out crusts to the critics, in mere defiance
or as a point of honour when he was challenged, which otherwise
his own good sense would have withheld. We suspect that Mr.
Wordsworth’s feelings are a little morbid in this respect, or that he
resents censure more than he is gratified by praise. Otherwise, the
tide has turned much in his favour of late years—he has a large body
of determined partisans—and is at present sufficiently in request with
the public to save or relieve him from the last necessity to which
a man of genius can be reduced—that of becoming the God of his
own idolatry!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH</h3>

<p class='c008'>The subject of the present article is one of the ablest and most
accomplished men of the age, both as a writer, a speaker, and a
converser. He is, in fact, master of almost every known topic,
whether of a passing or of a more recondite nature. He has lived
much in society, and is deeply conversant with books. He is a man
of the world and a scholar; but the scholar gives the tone to all his
other acquirements and pursuits. Sir James is by education and
habit, and we were going to add, by the original turn of his mind,
a college-man; and perhaps he would have passed his time most
happily and respectably, had he devoted himself entirely to that kind
of life. The strength of his faculties would have been best
developed, his ambition would have met its proudest reward, in the
accumulation and elaborate display of grave and useful knowledge.
As it is, it may be said, that in company he talks well, but too
much; that in writing he overlays the original subject and spirit of
the composition, by an appeal to authorities and by too formal a
method; that in public speaking the logician takes place of the
orator, and that he fails to give effect to a particular point or to urge
an immediate advantage home upon his adversary from the enlarged
scope of his mind, and the wide career he takes in the field of
argument.</p>

<p class='c011'>To consider him in the last point of view, first. As a political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>partisan, he is rather the lecturer than the advocate. He is able to
instruct and delight an impartial and disinterested audience by the
extent of his information, by his acquaintance with general principles,
by the clearness and aptitude of his illustrations, by vigour and
copiousness of style; but where he has a prejudiced or unfair
antagonist to contend with, he is just as likely to put weapons into
his enemy’s hands, as to wrest them from him, and his object seems
to be rather to deserve than to obtain success. The characteristics
of his mind are retentiveness and comprehension, with facility of
production: but he is not equally remarkable for originality of view,
or warmth of feeling, or liveliness of fancy. His eloquence is a little
rhetorical; his reasoning chiefly logical: he can bring down the
account of knowledge on a vast variety of subjects to the present
moment, he can embellish any cause he undertakes by the most
approved and graceful ornaments, he can support it by a host of facts
and examples, but he cannot advance it a step forward by placing
it on a new and triumphant ‘vantage-ground, nor can he overwhelm
and break down the artificial fences and bulwarks of sophistry by the
irresistible tide of manly enthusiasm. Sir James Mackintosh is an
accomplished debater, rather than a powerful orator: he is distinguished
more as a man of wonderful and variable talent than as a
man of commanding intellect. His mode of treating a question is
critical, and not parliamentary. It has been formed in the closet and
the schools, and is hardly fitted for scenes of active life, or the
collisions of party-spirit. Sir James reasons on the square; while
the arguments of his opponents are loaded with iron or gold. He
makes, indeed, a respectable ally, but not a very formidable opponent.
He is as likely, however, to prevail on a neutral, as he is almost
certain to be baffled on a hotly contested ground. On any question
of general policy or legislative improvement, the Member for Nairn
is heard with advantage, and his speeches are attended with effect:
and he would have equal weight and influence at other times, if it
were the object of the House to hear reason, as it is his aim to speak
it. But on subjects of peace or war, of political rights or foreign
interference, where the waves of party run high, and the liberty of
nations or the fate of mankind hangs trembling in the scales, though
he probably displays equal talent, and does full and heaped justice
to the question (abstractedly speaking, or if it were to be tried before
an impartial assembly), yet we confess we have seldom heard him,
on such occasions, without pain for the event. He did not slur his
own character and pretensions, but he compromised the argument.
He spoke <em>the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth</em>; but
the House of Commons (we dare aver it) is not the place where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth can be spoken with
safety or with advantage. The judgment of the House is not a
balance to weigh scruples and reasons to the turn of a fraction:
another element, besides the love of truth enters into the composition
of their decisions, the reaction of which must be calculated upon and
guarded against. If our philosophical statesman had to open the
case before a class of tyros, or a circle of grey-beards, who wished
to form or to strengthen their judgments upon fair and rational
grounds, nothing could be more satisfactory, more luminous, more
able or more decisive than the view taken of it by Sir James
Mackintosh. But the House of Commons, as a collective body,
have not the docility of youth, the calm wisdom of age; and often
only want an excuse to do wrong, or to adhere to what they have
already determined upon; and Sir James, in detailing the inexhaustible
stores of his memory and reading, in unfolding the wide
range of his theory and practice, in laying down the rules and the
exceptions, in insisting upon the advantages and the objections with
equal explicitness, would be sure to let something drop that a
dexterous and watchful adversary would easily pick up and turn
against him, if this were found necessary; or if with so many <em>pros</em>
and <em>cons</em>, doubts and difficulties, dilemmas and alternatives thrown
into it, the scale, with its natural bias to interest and power, did not
already fly up and kick the beam. There wanted unity of purpose,
impetuosity of feeling to break through the phalanx of hostile and
inveterate prejudice arrayed against him. He gave a handle to his
enemies; threw stumbling-blocks in the way of his friends. He
raised so many objections for the sake of answering them, proposed
so many doubts for the sake of solving them, and made so many
concessions where none were demanded, that his reasoning had the
effect of neutralizing itself; it became a mere exercise of the understanding
without zest or spirit left in it; and the provident engineer
who was to shatter in pieces the strong-holds of corruption and
oppression, by a well-directed and unsparing discharge of artillery,
seemed to have brought not only his own cannon-balls, but his own
wool-packs along with him to ward off the threatened mischief.
This was a good deal the effect of his maiden speech on the transfer
of Genoa, to which Lord Castlereagh did not deign an answer, and
which another Honourable Member called ‘a <em>finical</em> speech.’ It
was a most able, candid, closely argued, and philosophical exposure
of that unprincipled transaction; but for this very reason it was a
solecism in the place where it was delivered. Sir James has, since
this period, and with the help of practice, lowered himself to the
tone of the House; and has also applied himself to questions more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>congenial to his habits of mind, and where the success would be
more likely to be proportioned to his zeal and his exertions.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a greater degree of power, or of dashing and splendid
effect (we wish we could add, an equally humane and liberal spirit)
in the <cite>Lectures on the Law of Nature and Nations</cite>, formerly delivered
by Sir James (then Mr.) Mackintosh, in Lincoln’s-Inn Hall. He
showed greater confidence; was more at home there. The effect
was more electrical and instantaneous, and this elicited a prouder
display of intellectual riches, and a more animated and imposing
mode of delivery. He grew wanton with success. Dazzling
others by the brilliancy of his acquirements, dazzled himself by the
admiration they excited, he lost fear as well as prudence; dared
every thing, carried every thing before him. The Modern Philosophy,
counter-scarp, outworks, citadel, and all, fell without a blow,
by ‘the whiff and wind of his fell <em>doctrine</em>,’ as if it had been a pack
of cards. The volcano of the French Revolution was seen expiring
in its own flames, like a bonfire made of straw: the principles of
Reform were scattered in all directions, like chaff before the keen
northern blast. He laid about him like one inspired; nothing could
withstand his envenomed tooth. Like some savage beast got into
the garden of the fabled Hesperides, he made clear work of it, root
and branch, with white, foaming tusks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Laid waste the borders, and o’erthrew the bowers.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The havoc was amazing, the desolation was complete. As to our
visionary sceptics and Utopian philosophers, they stood no chance
with our lecturer—he did not ‘carve them as a dish fit for the
Gods, but hewed them as a carcase fit for hounds.’ Poor Godwin,
who had come, in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i> and candour of his nature, to hear
what new light had broken in upon his old friend, was obliged to
quit the field, and slunk away after an exulting taunt thrown out at
‘such fanciful chimeras as a golden mountain or a perfect man.’
Mr. Mackintosh had something of the air, much of the dexterity
and self-possession, of a political and philosophical juggler; and an
eager and admiring audience gaped and greedily swallowed the
gilded bait of sophistry, prepared for their credulity and wonder.
Those of us who attended day after day, and were accustomed to
have all our previous notions confounded and struck out of our hands
by some metaphysical legerdemain, were at last at some loss to know
<em>whether two and two made four</em>, till we had heard the lecturer’s
opinion on that head. He might have some mental reservation on
the subject, some pointed ridicule to pour upon the common supposition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>some learned authority to quote against it. To anticipate
the line of argument he might pursue, was evidently presumptuous
and premature. One thing only appeared certain, that whatever
opinion he chose to take up, he was able to make good either by
the foils or the cudgels, by gross banter or nice distinctions, by a
well-timed mixture of paradox and common-place, by an appeal to
vulgar prejudices or startling scepticism. It seemed to be equally
his object, or the tendency of his Discourses, to unsettle every
principle of reason or of common sense, and to leave his audience at
the mercy of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictum</span></i> of a lawyer, the nod of a minister, or the
shout of a mob. To effect this purpose, he drew largely on the
learning of antiquity, on modern literature, on history, poetry, and
the belles-lettres, on the Schoolmen and on writers of novels, French,
English, and Italian. In mixing up the sparkling julep, that by its
potent operation was to scour away the dregs and feculence and
peccant humours of the body politic, he seemed to stand with his
back to the drawers in a metaphysical dispensary, and to take out of
them whatever ingredients suited his purpose. In this way he had an
antidote for every error, an answer to every folly. The writings
of Burke, Hume, Berkeley, Paley, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor,
Grotius, Puffendorf, Cicero, Aristotle, Tacitus, Livy, Sully,
Machiavel, Guicciardini, Thuanus, lay open beside him, and he could
instantly lay his hand upon the passage, and quote them chapter and
verse to the clearing up of all difficulties, and the silencing of all
oppugners. Mr. Mackintosh’s Lectures were after all but a kind of
philosophical centos. They were profound, brilliant, new to his
hearers; but the profundity, the brilliancy, the novelty were not his
own. He was like Dr. Pangloss (not Voltaire’s, but Coleman’s)
who speaks only in quotations; and the pith, the marrow of Sir
James’s reasoning and rhetoric at that memorable period might be put
within inverted commas. It, however, served its purpose and the loud
echo died away. We remember an excellent man and a sound critic<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
going to hear one of these elaborate effusions; and on his want of
enthusiasm being accounted for from its not being one of the orator’s
brilliant days, he replied, ‘he did not think a man of genius could
speak for two hours without saying something by which he would
have been electrified.’ We are only sorry, at this distance of time,
for one thing in these Lectures—the tone and spirit in which they
seemed to have been composed and to be delivered. If all that body
of opinions and principles of which the orator read his recantation was
unfounded, and there was an end of all those views and hopes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>pointed to future improvement, it was not a matter of triumph or
exultation to the lecturer or any body else, to the young or the old,
the wise or the foolish; on the contrary, it was a subject of regret, of
slow, reluctant, painful admission—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of lamentation loud heard through the rueful air.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The immediate occasion of this sudden and violent change in Sir
James’s views and opinions was attributed to a personal interview
which he had had a little before his death with Mr. Burke, at his
house at Beaconsfield. In the latter end of the year 1796, appeared
the <cite>Regicide Peace</cite>, from the pen of the great apostate from liberty
and betrayer of his species into the hands of those who claimed it as
their property by divine right—a work imposing, solid in many
respects, abounding in facts and admirable reasoning, and in which all
flashy ornaments were laid aside for a testamentary gravity, (the
eloquence of despair resembling the throes and heaving and muttered
threats of an earthquake, rather than the loud thunderbolt)—and soon
after came out a criticism on it in <cite>The Monthly Review</cite>, doing justice
to the author and the style, and combating the inferences with force
and at much length; but with candour and with respect, amounting
to deference. It was new to Mr. Burke not to be called names by
persons of the opposite party; it was an additional triumph to him to
be spoken well of, to be loaded with well-earned praise by the author
of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vindiciæ Gallicæ</span></cite>. It was a testimony from an old, a powerful,
and an admired antagonist.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a> He sent an invitation to the writer to
come and see him; and in the course of three days’ animated
discussion of such subjects, Mr. Mackintosh became a convert not
merely to the graces and gravity of Mr. Burke’s style, but to the
liberality of his views, and the solidity of his opinions.—The
Lincoln’s-Inn Lectures were the fruit of this interview: such is the
influence exercised by men of genius and imaginative power over those
who have nothing to oppose to their unforeseen flashes of thought and
invention, but the dry, cold, formal, deductions of the understanding.
Our politician had time, during a few years of absence from his native
country, and while the din of war and the cries of party-spirit ‘were
lost over a wide and unhearing ocean,’ to recover from his surprise
and from a temporary alienation of mind; and to return in spirit, and
in the mild and mellowed maturity of age, to the principles and
attachments of his early life.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The appointment of Sir James Mackintosh to a Judgeship in India
was one, which, however flattering to his vanity or favourable to his
interests, was entirely foreign to his feelings and habits. It was an
honourable exile. He was out of his element among black slaves and
sepoys, and Nabobs and cadets, and writers to India. He had no one
to exchange ideas with. The ‘unbought grace of life,’ the charm of
literary conversation was gone. It was the habit of his mind, his
ruling passion to enter into the shock and conflict of opinions on
philosophical, political, and critical questions—not to dictate to raw
tyros or domineer over persons in subordinate situations—but to
obtain the guerdon and the laurels of superior sense and information
by meeting with men of equal standing, to have a fair field pitched, to
argue, to distinguish, to reply, to hunt down the game of intellect
with eagerness and skill, to push an advantage, to cover a retreat, to
give and take a fall—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is no wonder that this sort of friendly intellectual gladiatorship is
Sir James’s greatest pleasure, for it is his peculiar <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>. He has not
many equals, and scarcely any superior in it. He is too indolent for
an author; too unimpassioned for an orator: but in society he is just
vain enough to be pleased with immediate attention, good-humoured
enough to listen with patience to others, with great coolness and self-possession,
fluent, communicative, and with a manner equally free
from violence and insipidity. Few subjects can be started, on which
he is not qualified to appear to advantage as the gentleman and
scholar. If there is some tinge of pedantry, it is carried off by great
affability of address and variety of amusing and interesting topics.
There is scarce an author that he has not read; a period of history
that he is not conversant with; a celebrated name of which he has
not a number of anecdotes to relate; an intricate question that he is
not prepared to enter upon in a popular or scientific manner. If an
opinion in an abstruse metaphysical author is referred to, he is
probably able to repeat the passage by heart, can tell the side of the
page on which it is to be met with, can trace it back through various
descents to Locke, Hobbes, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, to a place in
some obscure folio of the Schoolmen or a note in one of the commentators
on Aristotle or Plato, and thus give you in a few moments’
space, and without any effort or previous notice, a chronological table
of the progress of the human mind in that particular branch of inquiry.
There is something, we think, perfectly admirable and delightful in
an exhibition of this kind, and which is equally creditable to the
speaker and gratifying to the hearer. But this kind of talent was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>no use in India: the intellectual wares, of which the Chief Judge
delighted to make a display, were in no request there. He languished
after the friends and the society he had left behind; and wrote over
incessantly for books from England. One that was sent him at this
time was an <cite>Essay on the Principles of Human Action</cite>; and the way in
which he spoke of that dry, tough, metaphysical <em>choke-pear</em>, showed
the dearth of intellectual intercourse in which he lived, and the
craving in his mind after those studies which had once been his pride,
and to which he still turned for consolation in his remote solitude.—Perhaps
to another, the novelty of the scene, the differences of mind
and manners might have atoned for a want of social and literary
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrémens</span></i>: but Sir James is one of those who see nature through the
spectacles of books. He might like to read an account of India;
but India itself with its burning, shining face would be a mere blank,
an endless waste to him. To persons of this class of mind things
must be translated into words, visible images into abstract propositions
to meet their refined apprehensions, and they have no more to say to
a matter-of-fact staring them in the face without a label in its mouth,
than they would to a hippopotamus!—We may add, before we quit
this point, that we cannot conceive of any two persons more different
in colloquial talents, in which they both excel, than Sir James
Mackintosh and Mr. Coleridge. They have nearly an equal range of
reading and of topics of conversation: but in the mind of the one we
see nothing but <em>fixtures</em>, in the other every thing is fluid. The ideas
of the one are as formal and tangible, as those of the other are
shadowy and evanescent. Sir James Mackintosh walks over the
ground, Mr. Coleridge is always flying off from it. The first knows
all that has been said upon a subject; the last has something to say
that was never said before. If the one deals too much in learned
<em>common-places</em>, the other teems with idle fancies. The one has a good
deal of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of genius, the other is all volatile salt.
The conversation of Sir James Mackintosh has the effect of reading
a well-written book, that of his friend is like hearing a bewildered
dream. The one is an Encyclopedia of knowledge, the other is a
succession of <em>Sybilline Leaves</em>!</p>

<p class='c011'>As an author, Sir James Mackintosh may claim the foremost rank
among those who pride themselves on artificial ornaments and acquired
learning, or who write what may be termed a <em>composite</em> style. His
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vindiciæ Gallicæ</span></cite> is a work of great labour, great ingenuity, great
brilliancy, and great vigour. It is a little too antithetical in the
structure of its periods, too dogmatical in the announcement of its
opinions. Sir James has, we believe, rejected something of the <em>false
brilliant</em> of the one, as he has retracted some of the abrupt extravagance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of the other. We apprehend, however, that our author is not one of
those who draw from their own resources and accumulated feelings,
or who improve with age. He belongs to a class (common in
Scotland and elsewhere) who get up school-exercises on any given
subject in a masterly manner at twenty, and who at forty are either
where they were—or retrograde, if they are men of sense and modesty.
The reason is, their vanity is weaned, after the first hey-day and
animal spirits of youth are flown, from making an affected display of
knowledge, which, however useful, is not their own, and may be
much more simply stated; they are tired of repeating the same
arguments over and over again, after having exhausted and rung the
changes on their whole stock for a number of times. Sir James
Mackintosh is understood to be a writer in the Edinburgh Review;
and the articles attributed to him there are full of matter of great pith
and moment. But they want the trim, pointed expression, the
ambitious ornaments, the ostentatious display and rapid volubility of
his early productions. We have heard it objected to his later compositions,
that his style is good as far as single words and phrases are
concerned, but that his sentences are clumsy and disjointed, and that
these make up still more awkward and sprawling paragraphs. This
is a nice criticism, and we cannot speak to its truth; but if the fact
be so, we think we can account for it from the texture and obvious
process of the author’s mind. All his ideas may be said to be given
preconceptions. They do not arise, as it were, out of the subject, or
out of one another at the moment, and therefore do not flow naturally
and gracefully from one another. They have been laid down beforehand
in a sort of formal division or frame-work of the understanding;
and the connection between the premises and the conclusion, between
one branch of a subject and another, is made out in a bungling and
unsatisfactory manner. There is no principle of fusion in the work;
he strikes after the iron is cold, and there is a want of malleability in
the style. Sir James is at present said to be engaged in writing a
<cite>History of England</cite> after the downfall of the house of Stuart. May
it be worthy of the talents of the author, and of the principles of the
period it is intended to illustrate!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. MALTHUS</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Malthus may be considered as one of those rare and fortunate
writers who have attained a <em>scientific</em> reputation in questions of moral
and political philosophy. His name undoubtedly stands very high
in the present age, and will in all probability go down to posterity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>with more or less of renown or obloquy. It was said by a person
well qualified to judge both from strength and candour of mind, that
‘it would take a thousand years at least to answer his work on
Population.’ He has certainly thrown a new light on that question,
and changed the aspect of political economy in a decided and material
point of view—whether he has not also endeavoured to spread a gloom
over the hopes and more sanguine speculations of man, and to cast a
slur upon the face of nature, is another question. There is this to
be said for Mr. Malthus, that in speaking of him, one knows what
one is talking about. He is something beyond a mere name—one
has not to <em>beat the bush</em> about his talents, his attainments, his vast
reputation, and leave off without knowing what it all amounts to—he
is not one of those great men, who set themselves off and strut
and fret an hour upon the stage, during a day-dream of popularity,
with the ornaments and jewels borrowed from the common stock,
to which nothing but their vanity and presumption gives them the
least individual claim—he has dug into the mine of truth, and brought
up ore mixed with dross! In weighing his merits we come at once
to the question of what he has done or failed to do. It is a specific
claim that he sets up. When we speak of Mr. Malthus, we mean
the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>; and when we mention the Essay on Population,
we mean a distinct leading proposition, that stands out intelligibly
from all trashy pretence, and is a ground on which to fix the levers
that may move the world, backwards or forwards. He has not left
opinion where he found it; he has advanced or given it a wrong bias,
or thrown a stumbling-block in its way. In a word, his name is not
stuck, like so many others, in the firmament of reputation, nobody
knows why, inscribed in great letters, and with a transparency of
<span class='sc'>Talents</span>, <span class='sc'>Genius</span>, <span class='sc'>Learning</span> blazing round it—it is tantamount to
an idea, it is identified with a principle, it means that <em>the population
cannot go on perpetually increasing without pressing on the limits of the
means of subsistence, and that a check of some kind or other must, sooner
or later, be opposed to it</em>. This is the essence of the doctrine which
Mr. Malthus has been the first to bring into general notice, and as we
think, to establish beyond the fear of contradiction. Admitting then
as we do the prominence and the value of his claims to public attention,
it yet remains a question, how far those claims are (as to the
talent displayed in them) strictly original; how far (as to the logical
accuracy with which he has treated the subject) he has introduced
foreign and doubtful matter into it; and how far (as to the spirit in
which he has conducted his inquiries, and applied a general principle
to particular objects) he has only drawn fair and inevitable conclusions
from it, or endeavoured to tamper with and wrest it to sinister and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>servile purposes. A writer who shrinks from following up a well-founded
principle into its untoward consequences from timidity or
false delicacy, is not worthy of the name of a philosopher: a writer
who assumes the garb of candour and an inflexible love of truth to
garble and pervert it, to crouch to power and pander to prejudice,
deserves a worse title than that of a sophist!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus’s first octavo volume on this subject (published in
the year 1798) was intended as an answer to Mr. Godwin’s <cite>Enquiry
concerning Political Justice</cite>. It was well got up for the purpose, and
had an immediate effect. It was what in the language of the ring is
called <em>a facer</em>. It made Mr. Godwin and the other advocates of
Modern Philosophy look about them. It may be almost doubted
whether Mr. Malthus was in the first instance serious in many things
that he threw out, or whether he did not hazard the whole as an
amusing and extreme paradox, which might puzzle the reader as it
had done himself in an idle moment, but to which no practical
consequence whatever could attach. This state of mind would
probably continue till the irritation of enemies and the encouragement
of friends convinced him that what he had at first exhibited as an
idle fancy was in fact a very valuable discovery, or ‘like the toad
ugly and venomous, had yet a precious jewel in its head.’ Such a
supposition would at least account for some things in the original
Essay, which scarcely any writer would venture upon, except as
professed exercises of ingenuity, and which have been since in part
retracted. But a wrong bias was thus given, and the author’s theory
was thus rendered warped, disjointed, and sophistical from the very
outset.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing could in fact be more illogical (not to say absurd) than
the whole of Mr. Malthus’s reasoning applied as an answer (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</span></i>) to Mr. Godwin’s book, or to the theories of other
Utopian philosophers. Mr. Godwin was not singular, but was kept
in countenance by many authorities, both ancient and modern, in
supposing a state of society possible in which the passions and wills
of individuals would be conformed to the general good, in which the
knowledge of the best means of promoting human welfare and the
desire of contributing to it would banish vice and misery from
the world, and in which, the stumbling-blocks of ignorance, of
selfishness, and the indulgence of gross appetite being removed, all
things would move on by the mere impulse of wisdom and virtue,
to still higher and higher degrees of perfection and happiness.
Compared with the lamentable and gross deficiencies of existing
institutions, such a view of futurity as barely possible could not fail
to allure the gaze and tempt the aspiring thoughts of the philanthropist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and the philosopher: the hopes and the imaginations of
speculative men could not but rush forward into this ideal world
as into a <em>vacuum</em> of good; and from ‘the mighty stream of tendency’
(as Mr. Wordsworth in the cant of the day calls it,) there was
danger that the proud monuments of time-hallowed institutions, that
the strong-holds of power and corruption, that ‘the Corinthian
capitals of polished society,’ with the base and pediments, might be
overthrown and swept away as by a hurricane. There were not
wanting persons whose ignorance, whose fears, whose pride, or whose
prejudices contemplated such an alternative with horror; and who
would naturally feel no small obligation to the man who should
relieve their apprehensions from the stunning roar of this mighty
change of opinion that thundered at a distance, and should be able,
by some logical apparatus or unexpected turn of the argument, to
prevent the vessel of the state from being hurried forward with the
progress of improvement, and dashed in pieces down the tremendous
precipice of human perfectibility. Then comes Mr. Malthus forward
with the geometrical and arithmetical ratios in his hands, and holds
them out to his affrighted contemporaries as the only means of
salvation. ‘For’ (so argued the author of the Essay) ‘let the
principles of Mr. Godwin’s Enquiry and of other similar works be
carried literally and completely into effect; let every corruption and
abuse of power be entirely got rid of; let virtue, knowledge, and
civilization be advanced to the greatest height that these visionary
reformers would suppose; let the passions and appetites be subjected
to the utmost control of reason and influence of public opinion:
grant them, in a word, all that they ask, and the more completely
their views are realized, the sooner will they be overthrown again,
and the more inevitable and fatal will be the catastrophe. For the
principle of population will still prevail, and from the comfort, ease,
and plenty that will abound, will receive an increasing force and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">impetus</span></i>; the number of mouths to be fed will have no limit, but the
food that is to supply them cannot keep pace with the demand for it;
we must come to a stop somewhere, even though each square yard,
by extreme improvements in cultivation, could maintain its man:
in this state of things there will be no remedy, the wholesome
checks of vice and misery (which have hitherto kept this principle
within bounds) will have been done away; the voice of reason will
be unheard; the passions only will bear sway; famine, distress,
havoc, and dismay will spread around; hatred, violence, war, and
bloodshed will be the infallible consequence, and from the pinnacle
of happiness, peace, refinement, and social advantage, we shall be
hurled once more into a profounder abyss of misery, want, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>barbarism than ever, by the sole operation of the principle of
population!’—Such is a brief abstract of the argument of the Essay.
Can any thing be less conclusive, a more complete fallacy and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio
principii</span></i>? Mr. Malthus concedes, he assumes a state of perfectibility,
such as his opponents imagined, in which the general good is to
obtain the entire mastery of individual interests, and reason of gross
appetites and passions: and then he argues that such a perfect
structure of society will fall by its own weight, or rather be undermined
by the principle of population, because in the highest possible
state of the subjugation of the passions to reason, they will be
absolutely lawless and unchecked, and because as men become
enlightened, quick sighted and public-spirited, they will show themselves
utterly blind to the consequences of their actions, utterly
indifferent to their own well-being and that of all succeeding generations,
whose fate is placed in their hands. This we conceive to be
the boldest paralogism that ever was offered to the world, or palmed
upon willing credulity. Against whatever other scheme of reform
this objection might be valid, the one it was brought expressly to
overturn was impregnable against it, invulnerable to its slightest
graze. Say that the Utopian reasoners are visionaries, unfounded;
that the state of virtue and knowledge they suppose, in which reason
shall have become all-in-all, can never take place, that it is inconsistent
with the nature of man and with all experience, well and
good—but to say that society will have attained this high and ‘palmy
state,’ that reason will have become the master-key to all our
motives, and that when arrived at its greatest power it will cease
to act at all, but will fall down dead, inert, and senseless before
the principle of population, is an opinion which one would think few
people would choose to advance or assent to, without strong inducements
for maintaining or believing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact, however, is, that Mr. Malthus found this argument entire
(the principle and the application of it) in an obscure and almost
forgotten work published about the middle of the last century,
entitled <cite>Various Prospects of Mankind, Nature, and Providence</cite>, by a
Scotch gentleman of the name of Wallace. The chapter in this work
on the Principle of Population, considered as a bar to all ultimate
views of human improvement, was probably written to amuse an idle
hour, or read as a paper to exercise the wits of some literary society
in the Northern capital, and no farther responsibility or importance
annexed to it. Mr. Malthus, by adopting and setting his name to it,
has given it sufficient currency and effect. It sometimes happens that
one writer is the first to discover a certain principle or lay down a
given observation, and that another makes an application of, or draws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>a remote or an immediate inference from it, totally unforeseen by the
first, and from which, in all probability, he might have widely dissented.
But this is not so in the present instance. Mr. Malthus
has borrowed (perhaps without consciousness, at any rate without
acknowledgment) both the preliminary statement, that the increase in
the supply of food ‘from a limited earth and a limited fertility’ must
have an end, while the tendency to increase in the principle of
population has none, without some external and forcible restraint on
it, and the subsequent use made of this statement as an insuperable bar
to all schemes of Utopian or progressive improvement—both these he
has borrowed (whole) from Wallace, with all their imperfections on
their heads, and has added more and greater ones to them out of his
own store. In order to produce something of a startling and dramatic
effect, he has strained a point or two. In order to quell and frighten
away the bugbear of Modern Philosophy, he was obliged to make a
sort of monster of the principle of population, which was brought into
the field against it, and which was to swallow it up quick. No half-measures,
no middle course of reasoning would do. With a view to
meet the highest possible power of reason in the new order of things,
Mr. Malthus saw the necessity of giving the greatest possible physical
weight to the antagonist principle, and he accordingly lays it down
that its operation is mechanical and irresistible. He premises these
two propositions as the basis of all his reasoning, 1. <em>That food is
necessary to man</em>; 2. <em>That the desire to propagate the species is an
equally indispensable law of our existence</em>:—thus making it appear that
these two wants or impulses are equal and coordinate principles of
action. If this double statement had been true, the whole scope and
structure of his reasoning (as hostile to human hopes and sanguine
speculations) would have been irrefragable; but as it is not true, the
whole (in that view) falls to the ground. According to Mr.
Malthus’s octavo edition, the sexual passion is as necessary to be
gratified as the appetite of hunger, and a man can no more exist
without propagating his species than he can live without eating.
Were it so, neither of these passions would admit of any excuses, any
delay, any restraint from reason or foresight; and the only checks to
the principle of population must be vice and misery. The argument
would be triumphant and complete. But there is no analogy, no
parity in the two cases, such as our author here assumes. No man
can live for any length of time without food; many persons live all
their lives without gratifying the other sense. The longer the craving
after food is unsatisfied, the more violent, imperious, and uncontroulable
the desire becomes; whereas the longer the gratification
of the sexual passion is resisted, the greater force does habit and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>resolution acquire over it; and, generally speaking, it is a well-known
fact, attested by all observation and history, that this latter passion is
subject more or less to controul from personal feelings and character,
from public opinions and the institutions of society, so as to lead either
to a lawful and regulated indulgence, or to partial or total abstinence,
according to the dictates of <em>moral restraint</em>, which latter check to the
inordinate excesses and unheard-of consequences of the principle of
population, our author, having no longer an extreme case to make out,
admits and is willing to patronize in addition to the two former and
exclusive ones of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</span></i> and <em>misery</em>, in the second and remaining editions
of his work. Mr. Malthus has shown some awkwardness or even
reluctance in softening down the harshness of his first peremptory
decision. He sometimes grants his grand exception cordially, proceeds
to argue stoutly, and to try conclusions upon it; at other times
he seems disposed to cavil about or retract it:—‘the influence of
moral restraint is very inconsiderable, or none at all.’ It is indeed
difficult (more particularly for so formal and nice a reasoner as Mr.
Malthus) to piece such contradictions plausibly or gracefully together.
We wonder how <em>he</em> manages it—how <em>any one</em> should attempt it!
The whole question, the <em>gist</em> of the argument of his early volume
turned upon this, ‘Whether vice and misery were the <em>only</em> actual or
possible checks to the principle of population?’ He then said they
were, and farewell to building castles in the air: he now says that
<em>moral restraint</em> is to be coupled with these, and that its influence
depends greatly on the state of laws and manners—and Utopia stands
where it did, a great way off indeed, but not turned <em>topsy-turvy</em> by
our magician’s wand! Should we ever arrive there, that is, attain to
a state of <em>perfect moral restraint</em>, we shall not be driven headlong back
into Epicurus’s stye for want of the only possible checks to population,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</span></i> and <em>misery</em>; and in proportion as we advance that way, that is,
as the influence of moral restraint is extended, the necessity for vice
and misery will be diminished, instead of being increased according
to the first alarm given by the Essay. Again, the advance of civilization
and of population in consequence with the same degree of moral
restraint (as there exists in England at this present time, for instance)
is a good, and not an evil—but this does not appear from the Essay.
The Essay shows that population is not (as had been sometimes taken
for granted) an abstract and unqualified good; but it led many
persons to suppose that it was an abstract and unqualified evil, to be
checked only by vice and misery; and producing, according to its
encouragement a greater quantity of vice and misery; and this error
the author has not been at sufficient pains to do away. Another
thing, in which Mr. Malthus attempted to <em>clench</em> Wallace’s argument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>was in giving to the disproportionate power of increase in the principle
of population and the supply of food a mathematical form, or reducing
it to the arithmetical and geometrical ratios, in which we believe Mr.
Malthus is now generally admitted, even by his friends and admirers,
to have been wrong. There is evidently no inherent difference in the
principle of increase in food or population; since a grain of corn, for
example, will propagate and multiply itself much faster even than the
human species. A bushel of wheat will sow a field; that field will
furnish seed for twenty others. So that the limit to the means of
subsistence is only the want of room to raise it in, or, as Wallace
expresses it, ‘a limited fertility and a limited earth.’ Up to the point
where the earth or any given country is fully occupied or cultivated,
the means of subsistence naturally increase in a geometrical ratio, and
will more than keep pace with the natural and unrestrained progress
of population; and beyond that point, they do not go on increasing
even in Mr. Malthus’s arithmetical ratio, but are stationary or nearly
so. So far, then, is this proportion from being universally and
mathematically true, that in no part of the world or state of society
does it hold good. But our theorist, by laying down this double
ratio as a law of nature, gains this advantage, that at all times it seems
as if, whether in new or old-peopled countries, in fertile or barren
soils, the population was pressing hard on the means of subsistence;
and again, it seems as if the evil increased with the progress of
improvement and civilization; for if you cast your eye at the scale
which is supposed to be calculated upon true and infallible <em>data</em>, you
find that when the population is at 8, the means of subsistence are at
4; so that here there is only a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deficit</span></i> of one-half; but when it is at
32, they have only got to 6, so that here there is a difference of 26
in 32, and so on in proportion; the farther we proceed, the more
enormous is the mass of vice and misery we must undergo, as a
consequence of the natural excess of the population over the means of
subsistence and as a salutary check to its farther desolating progress.
The mathematical Table, placed at the front of the Essay, therefore
leads to a secret suspicion or a barefaced assumption, that we ought
in mere kindness and compassion to give every sort of indirect and
under-hand encouragement (to say the least) to the providential
checks of vice and misery; as the sooner we arrest this formidable
and paramount evil in its course, the less opportunity we leave it of
doing incalculable mischief. Accordingly, whenever there is the
least talk of colonizing new countries, of extending the population, or
adding to social comforts and improvements, Mr. Malthus conjures
up his double ratios, and insists on the alarming results of advancing
them a single step forward in the series. By the same rule, it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>be better to return at once to a state of barbarism; and to take the
benefit of acorns and scuttle-fish, as a security against the luxuries and
wants of civilized life. But it is not our ingenious author’s wish to
hint at or recommend any alterations in existing institutions; and he
is therefore silent on that unpalatable part of the subject and natural
inference from his principles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Malthus’s ‘gospel is preached to the poor.’ He lectures
them on economy, on morality, the regulation of their passions
(which, he says, at other times, are amenable to no restraint) and on
the ungracious topic, that ‘the laws of nature, which are the laws of
God, have doomed them and their families to starve for want of a
right to the smallest portion of food beyond what their labour will
supply, or some charitable hand may hold out in compassion.’ This
is illiberal, and it is not philosophical. The laws of nature or of
God, to which the author appeals, are no other than a limited fertility
and a limited earth. Within those bounds, the rest is regulated by
the laws of man. The division of the produce of the soil, the price
of labour, the relief afforded to the poor, are matters of human
arrangement: while any charitable hand can extend relief, it is a
proof that the means of subsistence are not exhausted in themselves,
that the ‘tables are not full!’ Mr. Malthus says that the laws of
nature, which are the laws of God, have rendered that relief
physically impossible; and yet he would abrogate the poor-laws by
an act of the legislature, in order to take away that <em>impossible</em> relief,
which the laws of God deny, and which the laws of man <em>actually</em>
afford. We cannot think that this view of his subject, which is
prominent and dwelt on at great length and with much pertinacity, is
dictated either by rigid logic or melting charity! A labouring man
is not allowed to knock down a hare or a partridge that spoils his
garden: a country-squire keeps a pack of hounds: a lady of quality
rides out with a footman behind her, on two sleek, well-fed horses.
We have not a word to say against all this as exemplifying the spirit
of the English Constitution, as a part of the law of the land, or as an
artful distribution of light and shade in the social picture; but if any
one insists at the same time that ‘the laws of nature, which are the
laws of God, have doomed the poor and their families to starve,’
because the principle of population has encroached upon and swallowed
up the means of subsistence, so that not a mouthful of food is left <em>by
the grinding law of necessity</em> for the poor, we beg leave to deny both
fact and inference—and we put it to Mr. Malthus whether we are
not, in strictness, justified in doing so?</p>

<p class='c011'>We have, perhaps, said enough to explain our feeling on the
subject of Mr. Malthus’s merits and defects. We think he had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>opportunity and the means in his hands of producing a great work on
the principle of population; but we believe he has let it slip from his
having an eye to other things besides that broad and unexplored
question. He wished not merely to advance to the discovery of
certain great and valuable truths, but at the same time to overthrow
certain unfashionable paradoxes by exaggerated statements—to curry
favour with existing prejudices and interests by garbled representations.
He has, in a word, as it appears to us on a candid retrospect
and without any feelings of controversial asperity rankling in our
minds, sunk the philosopher and the friend of his species (a character
to which he might have aspired) in the sophist and party-writer.
The period at which Mr. Malthus came forward teemed with answers
to Modern Philosophy, with antidotes to liberty and humanity, with
abusive Histories of the Greek and Roman republics, with fulsome
panegyrics on the Roman Emperors (at the very time when we were
reviling Buonaparte for his strides to universal empire) with the slime
and offal of desperate servility—and we cannot but consider the
Essay as one of the poisonous ingredients thrown into the cauldron of
Legitimacy ‘to make it thick and slab.’ Our author has, indeed, so
far done service to the cause of truth, that he has counteracted many
capital errors formerly prevailing as to the universal and indiscriminate
encouragement of population under all circumstances; but he has
countenanced opposite errors, which if adopted in theory and practice
would be even more mischievous, and has left it to future philosophers
to follow up the principle, that some check must be provided for the
unrestrained progress of population, into a set of wiser and more
humane consequences. Mr. Godwin has lately attempted an answer
to the Essay (thus giving Mr. Malthus a <em>Roland for his Oliver</em>) but
we think he has judged ill in endeavouring to invalidate the principle,
instead of confining himself to point out the misapplication of it.
There is one argument introduced in this Reply, which will, perhaps,
amuse the reader as a sort of metaphysical puzzle.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It has sometimes occurred to me whether Mr. Malthus did not
catch the first hint of his geometrical ratio from a curious passage
of Judge Blackstone, on consanguinity, which is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The doctrine of lineal consanguinity is sufficiently plain and
obvious; but it is at the first view astonishing to consider the number
of lineal ancestors which every man has within no very great number
of degrees; and so many different bloods is a man said to contain in
his veins, as he hath lineal ancestors. Of these he hath two in the
first ascending degree, his own parents; he hath four in the second,
the parents of his father and the parents of his mother; he hath eight
in the third, the parents of his two grandfathers and two grand-mothers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and by the same rule of progression, he hath an hundred
and twenty-eight in the seventh; a thousand and twenty-four in the
tenth; and at the twentieth degree, or the distance of twenty
generations, every man hath above a million of ancestors, as common
arithmetic will demonstrate.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This will seem surprising to those who are unacquainted with the
increasing power of progressive numbers; but is palpably evident
from the following table of a geometrical progression, in which the
first term is 2, and the denominator also 2; or, to speak more
intelligibly, it is evident, for that each of us has two ancestors in the
first degree; the number of which is doubled at every remove, because
each of our ancestors had also two ancestors of his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This argument, however,’ (proceeds Mr. Godwin) ‘from Judge
Blackstone of a geometrical progression would much more naturally
apply to Montesquieu’s hypothesis of the depopulation of the world,
and prove that the human species is hastening fast to extinction, than
to the purpose for which Mr. Malthus has employed it. An ingenious
sophism might be raised upon it, to show that the race of mankind
will ultimately terminate in unity. Mr. Malthus, indeed, should have
reflected, that it is much more certain that every man has had
ancestors than that he will have posterity, and that it is still more
doubtful, whether he will have posterity to twenty or to an indefinite
number of generations.’—<span class='sc'>Enquiry concerning Population</span>, p. 100.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Mr. Malthus’s style is correct and elegant; his tone of controversy
mild and gentlemanly; and the care with which he has brought his
facts and documents together, deserves the highest praise. He has
lately quitted his favourite subject of population, and broke a lance
with Mr. Ricardo on the question of rent and value. The partisans
of Mr. Ricardo, who are also the admirers of Mr. Malthus, say that
the usual sagacity of the latter has here failed him, and that he has
shown himself to be a very illogical writer. To have said this of
him formerly on another ground, was accounted a heresy and a piece
of presumption not easily to be forgiven. Indeed Mr. Malthus has
always been a sort of ‘darling in the public eye,’ whom it was unsafe
to meddle with. He has contrived to make himself as many friends
by his attacks on the schemes of <cite>Human Perfectibility</cite> and on the
<cite>Poor-Laws</cite>, as Mandeville formerly procured enemies by his attacks
on <cite>Human Perfections</cite> and on <cite>Charity-Schools</cite>; and among other
instances that we might mention, <em>Plug</em> Pulteney, the celebrated miser,
of whom Mr. Burke said on his having a large estate left him, ‘that
now it was to be hoped he would <em>set up a pocket-handkerchief</em>,’ was so
enamoured with the saving schemes and humane economy of the
Essay, that he desired a friend to find out the author and offer him a
church living! This liberal intention was (by design or accident)
unhappily frustrated.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. GIFFORD</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Gifford was originally bred to some handicraft: he afterwards
contrived to learn Latin, and was for some time an usher in a school,
till he became a tutor in a nobleman’s family. The low-bred, self-taught
man, the pedant, and the dependant on the great contribute
to form the Editor of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>. He is admirably
qualified for this situation, which he has held for some years, by a
happy combination of defects, natural and acquired; and in the
event of his death, it will be difficult to provide him a suitable
successor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Gifford has no pretensions to be thought a man of genius,
of taste, or even of general knowledge. He merely understands
the mechanical and instrumental part of learning. He is a critic
of the last age, when the different editions of an author, or the
dates of his several performances were all that occupied the inquiries
of a profound scholar, and the spirit of the writer or the beauties of
his style were left to shift for themselves, or exercise the fancy
of the light and superficial reader. In studying an old author, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>has no notion of any thing beyond adjusting a point, proposing a
different reading, or correcting, by the collation of various copies,
an error of the press. In appreciating a modern one, if it is an
enemy, the first thing he thinks of is to charge him with bad
grammar—he scans his sentences instead of weighing his sense; or,
if it is a friend, the highest compliment he conceives it possible to
pay him is, that his thoughts and expressions are moulded on some
hackneyed model. His standard of <em>ideal</em> perfection is what he
himself now is, a person of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediocre</span></i> literary attainments: his utmost
contempt is shown by reducing any one to what he himself once
was, a person without the ordinary advantages of education and
learning. It is accordingly assumed, with much complacency in
his critical pages, that Tory writers are classical and courtly as a
matter of course; as it is a standing jest and evident truism, that
Whigs and Reformers must be persons of low birth and breeding—imputations
from one of which he himself has narrowly escaped, and
both of which he holds in suitable abhorrence. He stands over a
contemporary performance with all the self-conceit and self-importance
of a country schoolmaster, tries it by technical rules, affects not to
understand the meaning, examines the hand-writing, the spelling,
shrugs up his shoulders and chuckles over a slip of the pen, and
keeps a sharp look-out for a false concord and—a flogging. There
is nothing liberal, nothing humane in his style of judging: it is
altogether petty, captious, and literal. The Editor’s political subserviency
adds the last finishing to his ridiculous pedantry and vanity.
He has all his life been a follower in the train of wealth and power—strives
to back his pretensions on Parnassus by a place at court, and
to gild his reputation as a man of letters by the smile of greatness.
He thinks his works are stamped with additional value by having
his name in the <cite>Red-Book</cite>. He looks up to the distinctions of rank
and station as he does to those of learning, with the gross and over-weening
adulation of his early origin. All his notions are low,
upstart, servile. He thinks it the highest honour to a poet to be
patronised by a peer or by some dowager of quality. He is prouder
of a court-livery than of a laurel-wreath; and is only sure of having
established his claims to respectability by having sacrificed those of
independence. He is a retainer to the Muses; a door-keeper to
learning; a lacquey in the state. He believes that modern literature
should wear the fetters of classical antiquity; that truth is to be
weighed in the scales of opinion and prejudice; that power is
equivalent to right; that genius is dependent on rules; that taste
and refinement of language consist in <em>word-catching</em>. Many persons
suppose that Mr. Gifford knows better than he pretends; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>he is shrewd, artful, and designing. But perhaps it may be nearer
the mark to suppose that his dulness is guarantee for his sincerity;
or that before he is the tool of the profligacy of others, he is the
dupe of his own jaundiced feelings, and narrow, hood-winked perceptions.</p>

<p class='c015'>But this is less from choice or perversity, than because he cannot
help it and can do nothing else. He damns a beautiful expression
less out of spite than because he really does not understand it: any
novelty of thought or sentiment gives him a shock from which he
cannot recover for some time, and he naturally takes his revenge for
the alarm and uneasiness occasioned him, without referring to venal
or party motives. He garbles an author’s meaning, not so much
wilfully, as because it is a pain to him to enlarge his microscopic view
to take in the context, when a particular sentence or passage has
struck him as quaint and out of the way: he fly-blows an author’s
style, and picks out detached words and phrases for cynical reprobation,
simply because he feels himself at home, or takes a pride
and pleasure in this sort of petty warfare. He is tetchy and impatient
of contradiction; sore with wounded pride; angry at obvious faults,
more angry at unforeseen beauties. He has the <em>chalk-stones</em> in his
understanding, and from being used to long confinement, cannot
bear the slightest jostling or irregularity of motion. He may call
out with the fellow in the <cite>Tempest</cite>—‘I am not Stephano, but a
cramp!’ He would go back to the standard of opinions, style, the
faded ornaments, and insipid formalities that came into fashion about
forty years ago. Flashes of thought, flights of fancy, idiomatic
expressions, he sets down among the signs of the times—the extraordinary
occurrences of the age we live in. They are marks of a
restless and revolutionary spirit: they disturb his composure of mind,
and threaten (by implication) the safety of the state. His slow,
snail-paced, bed-rid habits of reasoning, cannot keep up with the
whirling, eccentric motion, the rapid, perhaps extravagant combinations
of modern literature. He has long been stationary himself,
and is determined that others shall remain so. The hazarding a
paradox is like letting off a pistol close to his ear: he is alarmed
and offended. The using an elliptical mode of expression (such
as he did not use to find in Guides to the English Tongue) jars him
like coming suddenly to a step in a flight of stairs that you were
not aware of. He <em>pishes</em> and <em>pshaws</em> at all this, exercises a sort of
interjectional criticism on what excites his spleen, his envy, or his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>wonder, and hurls his meagre anathemas <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</span></i> at all those
writers who are indifferent alike to his precepts and his example!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Gifford, in short, is possessed of that sort of learning which
is likely to result from an over-anxious desire to supply the want of
the first rudiments of education; that sort of wit, which is the offspring
of ill-humour or bodily pain; that sort of sense, which arises
from a spirit of contradiction and a disposition to cavil at and dispute
the opinions of others; and that sort of reputation, which is the
consequence of bowing to established authority and ministerial
influence. He dedicates to some great man, and receives his
compliments in return. He appeals to some great name, and the
Under-graduates of the two Universities look up to him as an oracle
of wisdom. He throws the weight of his verbal criticism and puny
discoveries in <em>black-letter</em> reading into the gap, that is supposed to be
making in the Constitution by Whigs and Radicals, whom he
qualifies without mercy as dunces and miscreants; and so entitles himself
to the protection of Church and State. The character of his mind
is an utter want of independence and magnanimity in all that he
attempts. He cannot go alone, he must have crutches, a go-cart
and trammels, or he is timid, fretful, and helpless as a child. He
cannot conceive of any thing different from what he finds it, and
hates those who pretend to a greater reach of intellect or boldness
of spirit than himself. He inclines, by a natural and deliberate bias,
to the traditional in laws and government; to the orthodox in
religion; to the safe in opinion; to the trite in imagination; to the
technical in style; to whatever implies a surrender of individual
judgment into the hands of authority, and a subjection of individual
feeling to mechanic rules. If he finds any one flying in the face of
these, or straggling from the beaten path, he thinks he has them
at a notable disadvantage, and falls foul of them without loss of
time, partly to soothe his own sense of mortified self-consequence,
and as an edifying spectacle to his legitimate friends. He takes
none but unfair advantages. He <em>twits</em> his adversaries (that is, those
who are not in the leading-strings of his school or party) with some
personal or accidental defect. If a writer has been punished for a
political libel, he is sure to hear of it in a literary criticism. If a
lady goes on crutches and is out of favour at court, she is reminded
of it in Mr. Gifford’s manly satire. He sneers at people of low
birth or who have not had a college education, partly to hide his
own want of certain advantages, partly as well-timed flattery to
those who possess them. He has a right to laugh at poor, unfriended,
untitled genius from wearing the livery of rank and letters, as footmen
behind a coronet-coach laugh at the rabble. He keeps good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>company, and forgets himself. He stands at the door of Mr.
Murray’s shop, and will not let any body pass but the well-dressed
mob, or some followers of the court. To edge into the <cite>Quarterly</cite>
Temple of Fame the candidate must have a diploma from the
Universities, a passport from the Treasury. Otherwise, it is a
breach of etiquette to let him pass, an insult to the better sort who
aspire to the love of letters—and may chance to drop in to the <cite>Feast
of the Poets</cite>. Or, if he cannot manage it thus, or get rid of the
claim on the bare ground of poverty or want of school-learning, he
<em>trumps</em> up an excuse for the occasion, such as that ‘a man was
confined in Newgate a short time before’—it is not a <em>lie</em> on the
part of the critic, it is only an amiable subserviency to the will of
his betters, like that of a menial who is ordered to deny his master,
a sense of propriety, a knowledge of the world, a poetical and moral
license. Such fellows (such is his cue from his employers) should
at any rate be kept out of privileged places: persons who have been
convicted of prose-libels ought not to be suffered to write poetry—if
the fact was not exactly as it was stated, it was something of the
kind, or it <em>ought</em> to have been so, the assertion was a pious fraud,—the
public, the court, the prince himself might read the work, but
for this mark of opprobrium set upon it—it was not to be endured
that an insolent plebeian should aspire to elegance, taste, fancy—it
was throwing down the barriers which ought to separate the higher
and the lower classes, the loyal and the disloyal—the paraphrase of
the story of Dante was therefore to perform quarantine, it was to
seem not yet recovered from the gaol infection, there was to be a
taint upon it, as there was none in it—and all this was performed by
a single slip of Mr. Gifford’s pen! We would willingly believe (if
we could) that in this case there was as much weakness and prejudice
as there was malice and cunning.—Again, we do not think it possible
that under any circumstances the writer of the <cite>Verses to Anna</cite> could
enter into the spirit or delicacy of Mr. Keats’s poetry. The fate of
the latter somewhat resembled that of</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be said in extenuation of the low, mechanic vein of these
impoverished lines, that they were written at an early age—they
were the inspired production of a youthful lover! Mr. Gifford was
thirty when he wrote them, Mr. Keats died when he was scarce
twenty! Farther it may be said, that Mr. Gifford hazarded his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>first poetical attempts under all the disadvantages of a neglected
education: but the same circumstance, together with a few unpruned
redundancies of fancy and quaintnesses of expression, was made the
plea on which Mr. Keats was hooted out of the world, and his fine
talents and wounded sensibilities consigned to an early grave. In
short, the treatment of this heedless candidate for poetical fame
might serve as a warning, and was intended to serve as a warning
to all unfledged tyros, how they venture upon any such doubtful
experiments, except under the auspices of some lord of the bedchamber
or Government Aristarchus, and how they imprudently
associate themselves with men of mere popular talent or independence
of feeling!—It is the same in prose works. The Editor scorns to
enter the lists of argument with any proscribed writer of the opposite
party. He does not refute, but denounces him. He makes no
concessions to an adversary, lest they should in some way be turned
against him. He only feels himself safe in the fancied insignificance
of others: he only feels himself superior to those whom he stigmatizes
as the lowest of mankind. All persons are without common-sense
and honesty who do not believe implicitly (with him) in the immaculateness
of Ministers and the divine origin of Kings. Thus he
informed the world that the author of <span class='sc'>Table-Talk</span> was a person who
could not write a sentence of common English and could hardly spell
his own name, because he was not a friend to the restoration of the
Bourbons, and had the assurance to write <cite>Characters of Shakespear’s
Plays</cite> in a style of criticism somewhat different from Mr. Gifford’s.
He charged this writer with imposing on the public by a flowery
style; and when the latter ventured to refer to a work of his, called
<cite>An Essay on the Principles of Human Action</cite>, which has not a single
ornament in it, as a specimen of his original studies and the proper
bias of his mind, the learned critic, with a shrug of great self-satisfaction,
said, ‘It was amusing to see this person, sitting like one
of Brouwer’s Dutch boors over his gin and tobacco-pipes, and fancying
himself a Leibnitz!’ The question was, whether the subject of
Mr. Gifford’s censure had ever written such a work or not; for if
he had, he had amused himself with something besides gin and
tobacco-pipes. But our Editor, by virtue of the situation he holds,
is superior to facts or arguments: he is accountable neither to the
public nor to authors for what he says of them, but owes it to his
employers to prejudice the work and vilify the writer, if the latter is
not avowedly ready to range himself on the stronger side.—The
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, besides the political <em>tirades</em> and denunciations of
suspected writers, intended for the guidance of the heads of families,
is filled up with accounts of books of Voyages and Travels for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>amusement of the younger branches. The poetical department is
almost a sinecure, consisting of mere summary decisions and a list of
quotations. Mr. Croker is understood to contribute the St. Helena
articles and the liberality, Mr. Canning the practical good sense,
Mr. D’Israeli the good-nature, Mr. Jacob the modesty, Mr. Southey
the consistency, and the Editor himself the chivalrous spirit and the
attacks on Lady Morgan. It is a double crime, and excites a double
portion of spleen in the Editor, when female writers are not advocates
of passive obedience and non-resistance. This Journal, then, is a
depository for every species of political sophistry and personal
calumny. There is no abuse or corruption that does not there find a
jesuitical palliation or a barefaced vindication. There we meet the
slime of hypocrisy, the varnish of courts, the cant of pedantry, the
cobwebs of the law, the iron hand of power. Its object is as
mischievous as the means by which it is pursued are odious. The
intention is to poison the sources of public opinion and of individual
fame—to pervert literature, from being the natural ally of freedom
and humanity, into an engine of priestcraft and despotism, and to
undermine the spirit of the English constitution and the independence
of the English character. The Editor and his friends systematically
explode every principle of liberty, laugh patriotism and public spirit
to scorn, resent every pretence to integrity as a piece of singularity or
insolence, and strike at the root of all free inquiry or discussion, by
running down every writer as a vile scribbler and a bad member of
society, who is not a hireling and a slave. No means are stuck at in
accomplishing this laudable end. Strong in patronage, they trample
on truth, justice, and decency. They claim the privilege of court-favourites.
They keep as little faith with the public, as with their
opponents. No statement in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> is to be trusted:
there is no fact that is not misrepresented in it, no quotation that is
not garbled, no character that is not slandered, if it can answer the
purposes of a party to do so. The weight of power, of wealth,
of rank is thrown into the scale, gives its impulse to the machine;
and the whole is under the guidance of Mr. Gifford’s instinctive
genius—of the inborn hatred of servility for independence, of dulness
for talent, of cunning and impudence for truth and honesty. It costs
him no effort to execute his disreputable task—in being the tool of
a crooked policy, he but labours in his natural vocation. He patches
up a rotten system as he would supply the chasms in a worm-eaten
manuscript, from a grovelling incapacity to do any thing better;
thinks that if a single iota in the claims of prerogative and power were
lost, the whole fabric of society would fall upon his head and crush
him; and calculates that his best chance for literary reputation is by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span><em>black-balling</em> one half of the competitors as Jacobins and levellers, and
securing the suffrages of the other half in his favour as a loyal subject
and trusty partisan!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Gifford, as a satirist, is violent and abrupt. He takes obvious
or physical defects, and dwells upon them with much labour and
harshness of invective, but with very little wit or spirit. He expresses
a great deal of anger and contempt, but you cannot tell very well why—except
that he seems to be sore and out of humour. His satire is
mere peevishness and spleen, or something worse—personal antipathy
and rancour. We are in quite as much pain for the writer, as for the
object of his resentment. His address to Peter Pindar is laughable
from its outrageousness. He denounces him as a wretch hateful to
God and man, for some of the most harmless and amusing trifles that
ever were written—and the very good-humour and pleasantry of
which, we suspect, constituted their offence in the eyes of this Drawcansir.—His
attacks on Mrs. Robinson were unmanly, and even those
on Mr. Merry and the Della-Cruscan School <em>were</em> much more
ferocious than the occasion warranted. A little affectation and
quaintness of style did not merit such severity of castigation.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a> As a
translator, Mr. Gifford’s version of the Roman satirist is the baldest,
and, in parts, the most offensive of all others. We do not know why he
attempted it, unless he had got it in his head that he should thus follow
in the steps of Dryden, as he had already done in those of Pope in
the Baviad and Mæviad. As an editor of old authors, Mr. Gifford
is entitled to considerable praise for the pains he has taken in revising
the text, and for some improvements he has introduced into it. He
had better have spared the notes, in which, though he has detected
the blunders of previous commentators, he has exposed his own
ill-temper and narrowness of feeling more. As a critic, he has
thrown no light on the character and spirit of his authors. He has
shown no striking power of analysis nor of original illustration,
though he has chosen to exercise his pen on writers most congenial to
his own turn of mind, from their dry and caustic vein; Massinger,
and Ben Jonson. What he will make of Marlowe, it is difficult to
guess. He has none of ‘the fiery quality’ of the poet. Mr. Gifford
does not take for his motto on these occasions—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spiritus precipitandus
est!</span></i>—His most successful efforts in this way are barely respectable.
In general, his observations are petty, ill-concocted, and discover as
little <em>tact</em>, as they do a habit of connected reasoning. Thus, for
instance, in attempting to add the name of Massinger to the list of
Catholic poets, our minute critic insists on the profusion of crucifixes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>glories, angelic visions, garlands of roses, and clouds of incense
scattered through the <em>Virgin-Martyr</em>, as evidence of the theological
sentiments meant to be inculcated by the play, when the least reflection
might have taught him, that they proved nothing but the author’s
poetical conception of the character and <em>costume</em> of his subject.
A writer might, with the same sinister, short-sighted shrewdness, be
accused of Heathenism for talking of Flora and Ceres in a poem on
the Seasons! What are produced as the exclusive badges and occult
proofs of Catholic bigotry, are nothing but the adventitious ornaments
and external symbols, the gross and sensible language, in a word, the
<em>poetry</em> of Christianity in general. What indeed shows the frivolousness
of the whole inference is that Deckar, who is asserted by our critic
to have contributed some of the most passionate and fantastic of these
devotional scenes, is not even suspected of a leaning to Popery. In
like manner, he excuses Massinger for the grossness of one of his
plots (that of the <cite>Unnatural Combat</cite>) by saying that it was supposed
to take place before the Christian era; by this shallow common-place
persuading himself, or fancying he could persuade others, that the
crime in question (which yet on the very face of the story is made
the ground of a tragic catastrophe) was first made <em>statutory</em> by the
Christian religion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The foregoing is a harsh criticism, and may be thought illiberal.
But as Mr. Gifford assumes a right to say what he pleases of others—they
may be allowed to speak the truth of him!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. JEFFREY</h3>

<p class='c008'>The <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> arose out of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, not as a corollary,
but in contradiction to it. An article had appeared in the latter on
Don Pedro Cevallos, which stung the Tories to the quick by the free
way in which it spoke of men and things, and something must be
done to check these <i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">escapades</span></i> of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>. It was not to be
endured that the truth should out in this manner, even occasionally
and half in jest. A startling shock was thus given to established
prejudices, the mask was taken off from grave hypocrisy, and the
most serious consequences were to be apprehended. The persons
who wrote in this Review seemed ‘to have their hands full of truths,’
and now and then, in a fit of spleen or gaiety, let some of them fly;
and while this practice continued, it was impossible to say that the
Monarchy or the Hierarchy was safe. Some of the arrows glanced,
others might stick, and in the end prove fatal. It was not the
principles of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, but the spirit that was looked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>with jealousy and alarm. The principles were by no means decidedly
hostile to existing institutions: but the spirit was that of fair and free
discussion; a field was open to argument and wit; every question
was tried upon its own ostensible merits, and there was no foul play.
The tone was that of a studied impartiality (which many called
<em>trimming</em>) or of a sceptical indifference. This tone of impartiality and
indifference, however, did not at all suit those who profited or existed
by abuses, who breathed the very air of corruption. They know
well enough that ‘those who are not <em>for</em> them are <em>against</em> them.’
They wanted a publication impervious alike to truth and candour;
that, hood-winked itself, should lead public opinion blindfold; that
should stick at nothing to serve the turn of a party; that should be the
exclusive organ of prejudice, the sordid tool of power; that should go
the whole length of want of principle in palliating every dishonest
measure, of want of decency in defaming every honest man; that should
prejudge every question, traduce every opponent; that should give
no quarter to fair inquiry or liberal sentiment; that should be ‘ugly
all over with hypocrisy,’ and present one foul blotch of servility,
intolerance, falsehood, spite, and ill manners. The <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
was accordingly set up.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sithence no fairy lights, no quickning ray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor stir of pulse, nor object to entice</div>
      <div class='line'>Abroad the spirits; but the cloister’d heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits squat at home, like Pagod in a niche</div>
      <div class='line'>Obscure!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This event was accordingly hailed (and the omen has been fulfilled!)
as a great relief to all those of his Majesty’s subjects who are firmly
convinced that the only way to have things remain exactly as they
are is to put a stop to all inquiries whether they are right or wrong,
and that if you cannot answer a man’s arguments, you may at least
try to take away his character.</p>

<p class='c011'>We do not implicitly bow to the political opinions, nor to the
critical decisions of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>; but we must do justice
to the talent with which they are supported, and to the tone of manly
explicitness in which they are delivered.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a> They are eminently
characteristic of the Spirit of the Age; as it is the express object
of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> to discountenance and extinguish that spirit,
both in theory and practice. The <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> stands upon
the ground of opinion; it asserts the supremacy of intellect: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>pre-eminence it claims is from an acknowledged superiority of talent
and information and literary attainment, and it does not build one
tittle of its influence on ignorance, or prejudice, or authority, or
personal malevolence. It takes up a question, and argues it <em>pro</em> and
<em>con</em> with great knowledge and boldness and skill; it points out an
absurdity, and runs it down, fairly, and according to the evidence
adduced. In the former case, its conclusions may be wrong, there
may be a bias in the mind of the writer, but he states the arguments
and circumstances on both sides, from which a judgment is to be
formed—it is not his cue, he has neither the effrontery nor the
meanness to falsify facts or to suppress objections. In the latter
case, or where a vein of sarcasm or irony is resorted to, the ridicule
is not barbed by some allusion (false or true) to private history; the
object of it has brought the infliction on himself by some literary
folly or political delinquency which is referred to as the understood
and justifiable provocation, instead of being held up to scorn as a
knave for not being a tool, or as a blockhead for thinking for himself.
In the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> the talents of those on the opposite
side are always extolled <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pleno ore</span></i>—in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> they are
denied altogether, and the justice that is in this way withheld from
them is compensated by a proportionable supply of personal abuse.
A man of genius who is a lord, and who publishes with Mr. Murray,
may now and then stand as good a chance as a lord who is not a
man of genius and who publishes with Messrs. Longman: but that
it the utmost extent of the impartiality of the <cite>Quarterly</cite>. From its
account you would take Lord Byron and Mr. Stuart Rose for two
very pretty poets; but Mr. Moore’s Magdalen Muse is sent to
Bridewell without mercy, to beat hemp in silk-stockings. In the
<cite>Quarterly</cite> nothing is regarded but the political creed or external
circumstances of a writer; in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> nothing is ever adverted
to but his literary merits. Or if there is a bias of any kind, it arises
from an affectation of magnanimity and candour in giving heaped
measure to those on the aristocratic side in politics, and in being
critically severe on others. Thus Sir Walter Scott is lauded to the
skies for his romantic powers, without any allusion to his political
demerits (as if this would be compromising the dignity of genius
and of criticism by the introduction of party-spirit)—while Lord
Byron is called to a grave moral reckoning. There is, however,
little of the cant of morality in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>—and it is
quite free from that of religion. It keeps to its province, which
is that of criticism—or to the discussion of debateable topics, and
acquits itself in both with force and spirit. This is the natural
consequence of the composition of the two Reviews. The one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>appeals with confidence to its own intellectual resources, to the
variety of its topics, to its very character and existence as a literary
journal, which depend on its setting up no pretensions but those
which it can make good by the talent and ingenuity it can bring to
bear upon them—it therefore meets every question, whether of a
lighter or a graver cast, on its own grounds; the other <em>blinks</em> every
question, for it has no confidence but in the <em>powers that be</em>—shuts
itself up in the impregnable fastnesses of authority, or makes some
paltry cowardly attack (under cover of anonymous criticism) on
individuals, or dispenses its award of merit entirely according to the
rank or party of the writer. The faults of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>
arise out of the very consciousness of critical and logical power.
In political questions it relies too little on the broad basis of liberty
and humanity, enters too much into mere dry formalities, deals too
often in <em>moot-points</em>, and descends too readily to a sort of special-pleading
in defence of <em>home</em> truths and natural feelings: in matters
of taste and criticism, its tone is sometimes apt to be supercilious
and <em>cavalier</em> from its habitual faculty of analysing defects and beauties
according to given principles, from its quickness in deciding, from
its facility in illustrating its views. In this latter department it has
been guilty of some capital oversights. The chief was in its treatment
of the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> at their first appearance—not in its
ridicule of their puerilities, but in its denial of their beauties, because
they were included in no school, because they were reducible to no
previous standard or theory of poetical excellence. For this, however,
considerable reparation has been made by the prompt and liberal
spirit that has been shown in bringing forward other examples of
poetical genius. Its capital sin, in a doctrinal point of view, has
been (we shrewdly suspect) in the uniform and unqualified encouragement
it has bestowed on Mr. Malthus’s system. We do not mean
that the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> was to join in the general <em>hue and cry</em>
that was raised against this writer; but while it asserted the soundness
of many of his arguments, and yielded its assent to the truths he
has divulged, it need not have screened his errors. On this subject
alone we think the <cite>Quarterly</cite> has the advantage of it. But as the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> is a mere mass and tissue of prejudices on all
subjects, it is the foible of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> to affect a somewhat
fastidious air of superiority over prejudices of all kinds, and a
determination not to indulge in any of the amiable weaknesses of our
nature, except as it can give a reason for the faith that is in it.
Luckily, it is seldom reduced to this alternative: ‘reasons’ are with
it ‘as plenty as blackberries!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Jeffrey is the Editor of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, and is understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>to have contributed nearly a fourth part of the articles from
its commencement. No man is better qualified for this situation;
nor indeed so much so. He is certainly a person in advance of the
age, and yet perfectly fitted both from knowledge and habits of
mind to put a curb upon its rash and headlong spirit. He is
thoroughly acquainted with the progress and pretensions of modern
literature and philosophy; and to this he adds the natural acuteness
and discrimination of the logician with the habitual caution and
coolness of his profession. If the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> may be considered
as the organ of or at all pledged to a party, that party is at
least a respectable one, and is placed in the middle between two
extremes. The Editor is bound to lend a patient hearing to the
most paradoxical opinions and extravagant theories which have
resulted in our times from the ‘infinite agitation of wit,’ but he is
disposed to qualify them by a number of practical objections, of
speculative doubts, of checks and drawbacks, arising out of actual
circumstances and prevailing opinions, or the frailties of human nature.
He has a great range of knowledge, an incessant activity of mind;
but the suspension of his judgment, the well-balanced moderation of
his sentiments, is the consequence of the very discursiveness of his
reason. What may be considered as a <em>common-place</em> conclusion is
often the result of a comprehensive view of all the circumstances of
a case. Paradox, violence, nay even originality of conception is not
seldom owing to our dwelling long and pertinaciously on some one
part of a subject, instead of attending to the whole. Mr. Jeffrey is
neither a bigot nor an enthusiast. He is not the dupe of the
prejudices of others, nor of his own. He is not wedded to any
dogma, he is not long the sport of any whim; before he can settle
in any fond or fantastic opinion, another starts up to match it, like
beads on sparkling wine. A too restless display of talent, a too
undisguised statement of all that can be said for and against a question,
is perhaps the great fault that is to be attributed to him. Where
there is so much power and prejudice to contend with in the opposite
scale, it may be thought that the balance of truth can hardly be
held with a slack or an even hand; and that the infusion of a
little more visionary speculation, of a little more popular indignation
into the great Whig Review would be an advantage
both to itself and to the cause of freedom. Much of this effect
is chargeable less on an Epicurean levity of feeling or on party-trammels,
than on real sanguineness of disposition, and a certain
fineness of professional tact. Our sprightly Scotchman is not of a
desponding and gloomy turn of mind. He argues well for the future
hopes of mankind from the smallest beginnings, watches the slow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>gradual, reluctant growth of liberal views, and smiling sees the aloe
of Reform blossom at the end of a hundred years; while the
habitual subtlety of his mind makes him perceive decided advantages
where vulgar ignorance or passion sees only doubts and difficulty;
and a flaw in an adversary’s argument stands him instead of
the shout of a mob, the votes of a majority, or the fate of a pitched
battle. The Editor is satisfied with his own conclusions, and does
not make himself uneasy about the fate of mankind. The issue, he
thinks, will verify his moderate and well-founded expectations.—We
believe also that late events have given a more decided turn to Mr.
Jeffrey’s mind, and that he feels that as in the struggle between
liberty and slavery, the views of the one party have been laid bare
with their success, so the exertions on the other side should become
more strenuous, and a more positive stand be made against the
avowed and appalling encroachments of priestcraft and arbitrary power.</p>

<p class='c011'>The characteristics of Mr. Jeffrey’s general style as a writer
correspond, we think, with what we have here stated as the characteristics
of his mind. He is a master of the foils; he makes an
exulting display of the dazzling fence of wit and argument. His
strength consists in great range of knowledge, an equal familiarity
with the principles and the details of a subject, and in a glancing
brilliancy and rapidity of style. Indeed, we doubt whether the
brilliancy of his manner does not resolve itself into the rapidity,
the variety and aptness of his illustrations. His pen is never at a
loss, never stands still; and would dazzle for this reason alone, like
an eye that is ever in motion. Mr. Jeffrey is far from a flowery or
affected writer; he has few tropes or figures, still less any odd
startling thoughts or quaint innovations in expression:—but he has
a constant supply of ingenious solutions and pertinent examples; he
never proses, never grows dull, never wears an argument to tatters;
and by the number, the liveliness and facility of his transitions, keeps
up that appearance of vivacity, of novel and sparkling effect, for which
others are too often indebted to singularity of combination or tinsel
ornaments.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be discovered, by a nice observer, that Mr. Jeffrey’s style
of composition is that of a person accustomed to public speaking.
There is no pause, no meagreness, no inanimateness, but a flow, a
redundance and volubility like that of a stream or of a rolling-stone.
The language is more copious than select, and sometimes two or
three words perform the office of one. This copiousness and facility
is perhaps an advantage in <em>extempore</em> speaking, where no stop or break
is allowed in the discourse, and where any word or any number of
words almost is better than coming to a dead stand; but in written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>compositions it gives an air of either too much carelessness or too
much labour. Mr. Jeffrey’s excellence, as a public speaker, has
betrayed him into this peculiarity. He makes fewer <em>blots</em> in addressing
an audience than any one we remember to have heard. There is not
a hair’s-breadth space between any two of his words, nor is there a
single expression either ill-chosen or out of its place. He speaks
without stopping to take breath, with ease, with point, with elegance,
and without ‘spinning the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple
of his argument.’ He may be said to weave words into any shapes
he pleases for use or ornament, as the glass-blower moulds the vitreous
fluid with his breath; and his sentences shine like glass from their
polished smoothness, and are equally transparent. His style of
eloquence, indeed, is remarkable for neatness, for correctness, and
epigrammatic point; and he has applied this as a standard to his
written compositions, where the very same degree of correctness and
precision produces, from the contrast between writing and speaking,
an agreeable diffuseness, freedom and animation. Whenever the
Scotch advocate has appeared at the bar of the English House of
Lords, he has been admired by those who were in the habit of
attending to speeches there, as having the greatest fluency of language
and the greatest subtlety of distinction of any one of the profession.
The law-reporters were as little able to follow him from the extreme
rapidity of his utterance as from the tenuity and evanescent nature of
his reasoning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Jeffrey’s conversation is equally lively, various, and instructive.
There is no subject on which he is not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</span></i>: no company in which
he is not ready to scatter his pearls for sport. Whether it be politics,
or poetry, or science, or anecdote, or wit, or raillery, he takes up his
cue without effort, without preparation, and appears equally incapable
of tiring himself or his hearers. His only difficulty seems to be, not
to speak, but to be silent. There is a constitutional buoyancy and
elasticity of mind about him that cannot subside into repose, much
less sink into dulness. There may be more original talkers, persons
who occasionally surprise or interest you more; few, if any, with a
more uninterrupted flow of cheerfulness and animal spirits, with
a greater fund of information, and with fewer specimens of the
<em>bathos</em> in their conversation. He is never absurd, nor has he any
favourite points which he is always bringing forward. It cannot be
denied that there is something bordering on petulance of manner, but
it is of that least offensive kind which may be accounted for from
merit and from success, and implies no exclusive pretensions nor the
least particle of ill-will to others. On the contrary, Mr. Jeffrey is
profuse of his encomiums and admiration of others, but still with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>certain reservation of a right to differ or to blame. He cannot rest
on one side of a question: he is obliged by a mercurial habit and
disposition to vary his point of view. If he is ever tedious, it is from
an excess of liveliness: he oppresses from a sense of airy lightness.
He is always setting out on a fresh scent: there are always <em>relays</em> of
topics; the harness is put to, and he rattles away as delightfully and
as briskly as ever. New causes are called; he holds a brief in his
hand for every possible question. This is a fault. Mr. Jeffrey is
not obtrusive, is not impatient of opposition, is not unwilling to be
interrupted; but what is said by another, seems to make no impression
on him; he is bound to dispute, to answer it, as if he was in Court,
or as if it were in a paltry Debating Society, where young beginners
were trying their hands. This is not to maintain a character, or for
want of good-nature—it is a thoughtless habit. He cannot help
cross-examining a witness, or stating the adverse view of the question.
He listens not to judge, but to reply. In consequence of this, you
can as little tell the impression your observations make on him as
what weight to assign to his. Mr. Jeffrey shines in mixed company;
he is not good in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>. You can only show your wisdom or
your wit in general society: but in private your follies or your
weaknesses are not the least interesting topics; and our critic has
neither any of his own to confess, nor does he take delight in hearing
those of others. Indeed in Scotland generally, the display of
personal character, the indulging your whims and humours in the
presence of a friend, is not much encouraged—every one there is
looked upon in the light of a machine or a collection of topics.
They turn you round like a cylinder to see what use they can make
of you, and drag you into a dispute with as little ceremony as they
would drag out an article from an Encyclopedia. They criticise
every thing, analyse every thing, argue upon every thing, dogmatise
upon every thing; and the bundle of your habits, feelings, humours,
follies and pursuits is regarded by them no more than a bundle of old
clothes. They stop you in a sentiment by a question or a stare, and
cut you short in a narrative by the time of night. The accomplished
and ingenious person of whom we speak, has been a little infected by
the tone of his countrymen—he is too didactic, too pugnacious, too
full of electrical shocks, too much like a voltaic battery, and reposes
too little on his own excellent good sense, his own love of ease, his
cordial frankness of temper and unaffected candour. He ought to
have belonged to us!</p>

<p class='c011'>The severest of critics (as he has been sometimes termed) is the
best-natured of men. Whatever there may be of wavering or
indecision in Mr. Jeffrey’s reasoning, or of harshness in his critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>decisions, in his disposition there is nothing but simplicity and
kindness. He is a person that no one knows without esteeming, and
who both in his public connections and private friendships, shows the
same manly uprightness and unbiassed independence of spirit. At
a distance, in his writings, or even in his manner, there may be
something to excite a little uneasiness and apprehension: in his
conduct there is nothing to except against. He is a person of strict
integrity himself, without pretence or affectation; and knows how to
respect this quality in others, without prudery or intolerance. He
can censure a friend or a stranger, and serve him effectually at the
same time. He expresses his disapprobation, but not as an excuse
for closing up the avenues of his liberality. He is a Scotchman
without one particle of hypocrisy, of cant, of servility, or selfishness
in his composition. He has not been spoiled by fortune—has not
been tempted by power—is firm without violence, friendly without
weakness—a critic and even-tempered, a casuist and an honest man—and
amidst the toils of his profession and the distractions of the
world, retains the gaiety, the unpretending carelessness and simplicity
of youth. Mr. Jeffrey in his person is slight, with a countenance
of much expression, and a voice of great flexibility and acuteness
of tone.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. BROUGHAM—SIR F. BURDETT</h3>

<p class='c008'>There is a class of eloquence which has been described and particularly
insisted on, under the style and title of <cite>Irish Eloquence</cite>: there is
another class which it is not absolutely unfair to oppose to this, and that
is the Scotch. The first of these is entirely the offspring of <em>impulse</em>:
the last of <em>mechanism</em>. The one is as full of fancy as it is bare of
facts: the other excludes all fancy, and is weighed down with facts.
The one is all fire, the other all ice: the one nothing but enthusiasm,
extravagance, eccentricity; the other nothing but logical deductions,
and the most approved postulates. The one without scruple, nay,
with reckless zeal, throws the reins loose on the neck of the
imagination: the other pulls up with a curb-bridle, and starts at
every casual object it meets in the way as a bugbear. The genius
of Irish oratory stands forth in the naked majesty of untutored nature,
its eye glancing wildly round on all objects, its tongue darting forked
fire: the genius of Scottish eloquence is armed in all the panoply of
the schools; its drawling, ambiguous dialect seconds its circumspect
dialectics; from behind the vizor that guards its mouth and shadows
its pent-up brows, it sees no visions but its own set purpose, its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><em>data</em>, and its own dogmas. It ‘has no figures, nor no fantasies,’ but
‘those which busy care draws in the brains of men,’ or which set off
its own superior acquirements and wisdom. It scorns to ‘tread the
primrose path of dalliance’—it shrinks back from it as from a
precipice, and keeps in the iron rail-way of the understanding. Irish
oratory, on the contrary, is a sort of aëronaut: it is always going up
in a balloon, and breaking its neck, or coming down in the parachute.
It is filled full with gaseous matter, with whim and fancy, with alliteration
and antithesis, with heated passion and bloated metaphors, that
burst the slender silken covering of sense; and the airy pageant, that
glittered in empty space and rose in all the bliss of ignorance, flutters
and sinks down to its native bogs! If the Irish orator riots in a
studied neglect of his subject and a natural confusion of ideas, playing
with words, ranging them into all sorts of fantastic combinations,
because in the unlettered void or chaos of his mind there is no obstacle
to their coalescing into any shapes they please, it must be confessed
that the eloquence of the Scotch is encumbered with an excess of
knowledge, that it cannot get on for a crowd of difficulties, that it
staggers under a load of topics, that it is so environed in the forms of
logic and rhetoric as to be equally precluded from originality or
absurdity, from beauty or deformity:—the plea of humanity is lost
by going through the process of law, the firm and manly tone of
principle is exchanged for the wavering and pitiful cant of policy, the
living bursts of passion are reduced to a defunct <em>common-place</em>, and all
true imagination is buried under the dust and rubbish of learned
models and imposing authorities. If the one is a bodiless phantom,
the other is a lifeless skeleton: if the one in its feverish and hectic
extravagance resembles a sick man’s dream, the other is akin to the
sleep of death—cold, stiff, unfeeling, monumental! Upon the whole,
we despair less of the first than of the last, for the principle of life
and motion is, after all, the primary condition of all genius. The
luxuriant wildness of the one may be disciplined, and its excesses
sobered down into reason; but the dry and rigid formality of the
other can never burst the shell or husk of oratory. It is true that
the one is disfigured by the puerilities and affectation of a Phillips;
but then it is redeemed by the manly sense and fervour of a Plunket,
the impassioned appeals and flashes of wit of a Curran, and by the
golden tide of wisdom, eloquence, and fancy, that flowed from the
lips of a Burke. In the other, we do not sink so low in the negative
series; but we get no higher in the ascending scale than a Mackintosh
or a Brougham.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> It may be suggested that the late Lord Erskine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>enjoyed a higher reputation as an orator than either of these: but he
owed it to a dashing and graceful manner, to presence of mind, and
to great animation in delivering his sentiments. Stripped of these
outward and personal advantages, the matter of his speeches, like that
of his writings, is nothing, or perfectly inert and dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Brougham is from the North of England, but he was educated
in Edinburgh, and represents that school of politics and political
economy in the House. He differs from Sir James Mackintosh in
this, that he deals less in abstract principles, and more in individual
details. He makes less use of general topics, and more of immediate
facts. Sir James is better acquainted with the balance of an argument
in old authors; Mr. Brougham with the balance of power in
Europe. If the first is better versed in the progress of history, no
man excels the last in a knowledge of the course of exchange. He
is apprised of the exact state of our exports and imports, and scarce a
ship clears out its cargo at Liverpool or Hull, but he has notice of
the bill of lading. Our colonial policy, prison-discipline, the state
of the Hulks, agricultural distress, commerce and manufactures, the
Bullion question, the Catholic question, the Bourbons or the Inquisition,
‘domestic treason, foreign levy,’ nothing can come amiss to
him—he is at home in the crooked mazes of rotten boroughs, is not
baffled by Scotch law, and can follow the meaning of one of Mr.
Canning’s speeches. With so many resources, with such variety and
solidity of information, Mr. Brougham is rather a powerful and
alarming, than an effectual debater. In so many details (which he
himself goes through with unwearied and unshrinking resolution) the
spirit of the question is lost to others who have not the same voluntary
power of attention or the same interest in hearing that he has in
speaking; the original impulse that urged him forward is forgotten
in so wide a field, in so interminable a career. If he can, others
<em>cannot</em> carry all he knows in their heads at the same time; a rope of
circumstantial evidence does not hold well together, nor drag the
unwilling mind along with it (the willing mind hurries on before it,
and grows impatient and absent)—he moves in an unmanageable
procession of facts and proofs, instead of coming to the point at once—and
his premises (so anxious is he to proceed on sure and ample
grounds) overlay and block up his conclusion, so that you cannot
arrive at it, or not till the first fury and shock of the onset is over.
The ball, from the too great width of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calibre</span></i> from which it is
sent, and from striking against such a number of hard, projecting
points, is almost spent before it reaches its destination. He keeps a
ledger or a debtor-and-creditor account between the Government and
the Country, posts so much actual crime, corruption, and injustice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>against so much contingent advantage or sluggish prejudice, and at
the bottom of the page brings in the balance of indignation and contempt,
where it is due. But people are not to be <em>calculated into</em>
contempt or indignation on abstract grounds; for however they may
submit to this process where their own interests are concerned, in
what regards the public good we believe they must see and feel
instinctively, or not at all. There is (it is to be lamented) a good
deal of froth as well as strength in the popular spirit, which will not
admit of being <em>decanted</em> or served out in formal driblets; nor will
spleen (the soul of Opposition) bear to be corked up in square patent
bottles, and kept for future use! In a word, Mr. Brougham’s is
ticketed and labelled eloquence, registered and in numeros (like the
successive parts of a Scotch Encyclopedia)—it is clever, knowing,
imposing, masterly, an extraordinary display of clearness of head, of
quickness and energy of thought, of application and industry; but it
is not the eloquence of the imagination or the heart, and will never
save a nation or an individual from perdition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Brougham has one considerable advantage in debate: he is
overcome by no false modesty, no deference to others. But then, by
a natural consequence or parity of reasoning, he has little sympathy
with other people, and is liable to be mistaken in the effect his arguments
will have upon them. He relies too much, among other things,
on the patience of his hearers, and on his ability to turn every thing
to his own advantage. He accordingly goes to the full length of <em>his
tether</em> (in vulgar phrase) and often overshoots the mark. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est
dommage.</span></i> He has no reserve of discretion, no retentiveness of mind
or check upon himself. He needs, with so much wit,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As much again to govern it.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He cannot keep a good thing or a shrewd piece of information in his
possession, though the letting it out should mar a cause. It is not
that he thinks too much of himself, too little of his cause: but he is
absorbed in the pursuit of truth as an abstract inquiry, he is led away
by the headstrong and overmastering activity of his own mind. He
is borne along, almost involuntarily, and not impossibly against his
better judgment, by the throng and restlessness of his ideas as by
a crowd of people in motion. His perceptions are literal, tenacious,
<em>epileptic</em>—his understanding voracious of facts, and equally communicative
of them—and he proceeds to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——Pour out all as plain</div>
      <div class='line'>As downright Shippen or as old Montaigne’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>without either the virulence of the one or the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i> of the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>The repeated, smart, unforeseen discharges of the truth jar those that
are next him. He does not dislike this state of irritation and
collision, indulges his curiosity or his triumph, till by calling for
more facts or hazarding some extreme inference, he urges a question
to the verge of a precipice, his adversaries urge it <em>over</em>, and he himself
shrinks back from the consequence—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Scared at the sound himself has made!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Brougham has great fearlessness, but not equal firmness; and
after going too far on the <em>forlorn hope</em>, turns short round without due
warning to others or respect for himself. He is adventurous, but
easily panic-struck; and sacrifices the vanity of self-opinion to the
necessity of self-preservation. He is too improvident for a leader,
too petulant for a partisan; and does not sufficiently consult those
with whom he is supposed to act in concert. He sometimes leaves
them in the lurch, and is sometimes left in the lurch by them. He
wants the principle of co-operation. He frequently, in a fit of
thoughtless levity, gives an unexpected turn to the political machine,
which alarms older and more experienced heads: if he was not himself
the first to get out of harm’s way and escape from the danger, it
would be well!—We hold, indeed, as a general rule, that no man
born or bred in Scotland can be a great orator, unless he is a mere
quack; or a great statesman, unless he turns plain knave. The
national gravity is against the first: the national caution is against
the last. To a Scotchman if a thing <em>is</em>, <em>it is</em>; there is an end of the
question with his opinion about it. He is positive and abrupt, and is
not in the habit of conciliating the feelings or soothing the follies of
others. His only way therefore to produce a popular effect is to sail
with the stream of prejudice, and to vent common dogmas, ‘the total
grist, unsifted, husks and all,’ from some evangelical pulpit. This
may answer, and it has answered. On the other hand, if a Scotchman,
born or bred, comes to think at all of the feelings of others, it
is not as they regard them, but as their opinion reacts on his own
interest and safety. He is therefore either pragmatical and offensive,
or if he tries to please, he becomes cowardly and fawning. His
public spirit wants pliancy; his selfish compliances go all lengths.
He is as impracticable as a popular partisan, as he is mischievous as a
tool of Government. We do not wish to press this argument farther,
and must leave it involved in some degree of obscurity, rather than
bring the armed intellect of a whole nation on our heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Brougham speaks in a loud and unmitigated tone of voice,
sometimes almost approaching to a scream. He is fluent, rapid,
vehement, full of his subject, with evidently a great deal to say, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>very regardless of the manner of saying it. As a lawyer, he has not
hitherto been remarkably successful. He is not profound in cases
and reports, nor does he take much interest in the peculiar features of
a particular cause, or show much adroitness in the management of it.
He carries too much weight of metal for ordinary and petty occasions:
he must have a pretty large question to discuss, and must
make <em>thorough-stitch</em> work of it. He, however, had an encounter
with Mr. Phillips the other day, and shook all his tender blossoms,
so that they fell to the ground, and withered in an hour; but they
soon bloomed again! Mr. Brougham writes almost, if not quite, as
well as he speaks. In the midst of an Election contest he comes out
to address the populace, and goes back to his study to finish an article
for the Edinburgh Review; sometimes indeed wedging three or
four articles (in the shape of <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">refaccimentos</span></i> of his own pamphlets
or speeches in parliament) into a single number. Such indeed is
the activity of his mind that it appears to require neither repose,
nor any other stimulus than a delight in its own exercise. He can
turn his hand to any thing, but he cannot be idle. There are few
intellectual accomplishments which he does not possess, and possess
in a very high degree. He speaks French (and, we believe, several
other modern languages) fluently: is a capital mathematician, and
obtained an introduction to the celebrated Carnot in this latter
character, when the conversation turned on squaring the circle, and
not on the propriety of confining France within the natural boundary
of the Rhine. Mr. Brougham is, in fact, a striking instance of the
versatility and strength of the human mind, and also in one sense
of the length of human life, if we make a good use of our time.
There is room enough to crowd almost every art and science into
it. If we pass ‘no day without a line,’ visit no place without the
company of a book, we may with ease fill libraries or empty them
of their contents. Those who complain of the shortness of life,
let it slide by them without wishing to seize and make the most of
its golden minutes. The more we do, the more we can do; the
more busy we are, the more leisure we have. If any one possesses
any advantage in a considerable degree, he may make himself master
of nearly as many more as he pleases, by employing his spare time
and cultivating the waste faculties of his mind. While one person
is determining on the choice of a profession or study, another shall
have made a fortune or gained a merited reputation. While one
person is dreaming over the meaning of a word, another will have
learnt several languages. It is not incapacity, but indolence,
indecision, want of imagination, and a proneness to a sort of mental
tautology, to repeat the same images and tread the same circle, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>leaves us so poor, so dull, and inert as we are, so naked of acquirement,
so barren of resources! While we are walking backwards
and forwards between Charing-Cross and Temple-Bar, and sitting
in the same coffee-house every day, we might make the grand tour
of Europe, and visit the Vatican and the Louvre. Mr. Brougham,
among other means of strengthening and enlarging his views, has
visited, we believe, most of the courts, and turned his attention to
most of the Constitutions of the continent. He is, no doubt, a
very accomplished, active-minded, and admirable person.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Francis Burdett, in many respects, affords a contrast to the
foregoing character. He is a plain, unaffected, unsophisticated
English gentleman. He is a person of great reading too and
considerable information, but he makes very little display of these,
unless it be to quote Shakespear, which he does often with extreme
aptness and felicity. Sir Francis is one of the most pleasing speakers
in the House, and is a prodigious favourite of the English people.
So he ought to be: for he is one of the few remaining examples of
the old English understanding and old English character. All that
he pretends to is common sense and common honesty; and a greater
compliment cannot be paid to these than the attention with which
he is listened to in the House of Commons. We cannot conceive
a higher proof of courage than the saying things which he has been
known to say there; and we have seen him blush and appear
ashamed of the truths he has been obliged to utter, like a bashful
novice. He could not have uttered what he often did there, if,
besides his general respectability, he had not been a very honest, a
very good-tempered, and a very good-looking man. But there was
evidently no wish to shine, nor any desire to offend: it was painful
to him to hurt the feelings of those who heard him, but it was a
higher duty in him not to suppress his sincere and earnest convictions.
It is wonderful how much virtue and plain-dealing a man may be
guilty of with impunity, if he has no vanity, or ill-nature, or duplicity
to provoke the contempt or resentment of others, and to make them
impatient of the superiority he sets up over them. We do not
recollect that Sir Francis ever endeavoured to atone for any
occasional indiscretions or intemperance by giving the Duke of York
credit for the battle of Waterloo, or congratulating Ministers on the
confinement of Buonaparte at St. Helena. There is no honest
cause which he dares not avow: no oppressed individual that he is
not forward to succour. He has the firmness of manhood with the
unimpaired enthusiasm of youthful feeling about him. His principles
are mellowed and improved, without having become less sound with
time: for at one period he sometimes appeared to come charged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the House with the petulance and caustic sententiousness he had
imbibed at Wimbledon Common. He is never violent or in
extremes, except when the people or the parliament happen to be
out of their senses; and then he seems to regret the necessity of
plainly telling them he thinks so, instead of pluming himself upon
it or exulting over impending calamities. There is only one error
he seems to labour under (which, we believe, he also borrowed from
Mr. Horne Tooke or Major Cartwright), the wanting to go back
to the early times of our Constitution and history in search of the
principles of law and liberty. He might as well</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Liberty, in our opinion, is but a modern invention (the growth of
books and printing)—and whether new or old, is not the less
desirable. A man may be a patriot, without being an antiquary.
This is the only point on which Sir Francis is at all inclined to a
tincture of pedantry. In general, his love of liberty is pure, as it is
warm and steady: his humanity is unconstrained and free. His
heart does not ask leave of his head to feel; nor does prudence
always keep a guard upon his tongue or his pen. No man writes
a better letter to his Constituents than the Member for Westminster;
and his compositions of that kind ought to be good, for they have
occasionally cost him dear. He is the idol of the people of Westminster:
few persons have a greater number of friends and well-wishers;
and he has still greater reason to be proud of his enemies,
for his integrity and independence have made them so. Sir Francis
Burdett has often been left in a Minority in the House of Commons,
with only one or two on his side. We suspect, unfortunately for
his country, that History will be found to enter its protest on the
same side of the question!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>LORD ELDON AND MR. WILBERFORCE</h3>

<p class='c008'>Lord Eldon is an exceedingly good-natured man; but this does
not prevent him, like other good-natured people, from consulting his
own ease or interest. The character of <em>good-nature</em>, as it is called,
has been a good deal mistaken; and the present Chancellor is not
a bad illustration of the grounds of the prevailing error. When we
happen to see an individual whose countenance is ‘all tranquillity and
smiles;’ who is full of good-humour and pleasantry; whose manners
are gentle and conciliating; who is uniformly temperate in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>expressions, and punctual and just in his every-day dealings; we are
apt to conclude from so fair an outside, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘All is conscience and tender heart’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>within also, and that such a one would not hurt a fly. And neither
would he without a motive. But mere good-nature (or what passes
in the world for such) is often no better than indolent selfishness.
A person distinguished and praised for this quality will not needlessly
offend others, because they may retaliate; and besides, it ruffles his
own temper. He likes to enjoy a perfect calm, and to live in an
interchange of kind offices. He suffers few things to irritate or
annoy him. He has a fine oiliness in his disposition, which smooths
the waves of passion as they rise. He does not enter into the
quarrels or enmities of others; bears their calamities with patience;
he listens to the din and clang of war, the earthquake and the
hurricane of the political and moral world with the temper and
spirit of a philosopher; no act of injustice puts him beside himself,
the follies and absurdities of mankind never give him a moment’s
uneasiness, he has none of the ordinary causes of fretfulness or
chagrin that torment others from the undue interest they take in the
conduct of their neighbours or in the public good. None of these
idle or frivolous sources of discontent, that make such havoc with
the peace of human life, ever discompose his features or alter the
serenity of his pulse. If a nation is robbed of its rights,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘If wretches hang that Ministers may dine,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>the laughing jest still collects in his eye, the cordial squeeze of the
hand is still the same. But tread on the toe of one of these amiable
and imperturbable mortals, or let a lump of soot fall down the chimney
and spoil their dinners, and see how they will bear it. All their
patience is confined to the accidents that befal others: all their good-humour
is to be resolved into giving themselves no concern about any
thing but their own ease and self-indulgence. Their charity begins
and ends at home. Their being free from the common infirmities of
temper is owing to their indifference to the common feelings of
humanity; and if you touch the sore place, they betray more resentment,
and break out (like spoiled children) into greater fractiousness
than others, partly from a greater degree of selfishness, and partly
because they are taken by surprise, and mad to think they have not
guarded every point against annoyance or attack, by a habit of callous
insensibility and pampered indolence.</p>

<p class='c011'>An instance of what we mean occurred but the other day. An
allusion was made in the House of Commons to something in the
proceedings in the Court of Chancery, and the Lord Chancellor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>comes to his place in the Court, with the statement in his hand, fire
in his eyes, and a direct charge of falsehood in his mouth, without
knowing any thing certain of the matter, without making any inquiry
into it, without using any precaution or putting the least restraint
upon himself, and all on no better authority than a common newspaper
report. The thing was (not that we are imputing any strong
blame in this case, we merely bring it as an illustration) it touched
himself, his office, the inviolability of his jurisdiction, the unexceptionableness
of his proceedings, and the wet blanket of the Chancellor’s
temper instantly took fire like tinder! All the fine balancing was
at an end; all the doubts, all the delicacy, all the candour real or
affected, all the chances that there might be a mistake in the report,
all the decencies to be observed towards a Member of the House, are
overlooked by the blindness of passion, and the wary Judge pounces upon
the paragraph without mercy, without a moment’s delay, or the
smallest attention to forms! This was indeed serious business, there
was to be no trifling here; every instant was an age till the Chancellor
had discharged his sense of indignation on the head of the indiscreet
interloper on his authority. Had it been another person’s case, another
person’s dignity that had been compromised, another person’s conduct
that had been called in question, who doubts but that the matter
might have stood over till the next term, that the Noble Lord would
have taken the Newspaper home in his pocket, that he would have
compared it carefully with other newspapers, that he would have
written in the most mild and gentlemanly terms to the Honourable
Member to inquire into the truth of the statement, that he would
have watched a convenient opportunity good-humouredly to ask other
Honourable Members what all this was about, that the greatest
caution and fairness would have been observed, and that to this hour the
lawyers’ clerks and the junior counsel would have been in the greatest
admiration of the Chancellor’s nicety of discrimination, and the utter
inefficacy of the heats, importunities, haste, and passions of others to
influence his judgment? This would have been true; yet his readiness
to decide and to condemn where he himself is concerned, shows
that passion is not dead in him, nor subject to the control of
reason; but that self-love is the mainspring that moves it, though
on all beyond that limit he looks with the most perfect calmness and
philosophic indifference.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Resistless passion sways us to the mood</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what it likes or loaths.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>All people are passionate in what concerns themselves, or in what
they take an interest in. The range of this last is different in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>persons; but the want of passion is but another name for the want of
sympathy and imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor’s impartiality and conscientious exactness
are proverbial; and is, we believe, as inflexible as it is delicate in
all cases that occur in the stated routine of legal practice. The
impatience, the irritation, the hopes, the fears, the confident tone of
the applicants move him not a jot from his intended course, he looks
at their claims with the ‘lack lustre eye’ of professional indifference.
Power and influence apart, his next strongest passion is to indulge in
the exercise of professional learning and skill, to amuse himself with
the dry details and intricate windings of the law of equity. He
delights to balance a straw, to see a feather turn the scale, or make it
even again; and divides and subdivides a scruple to the smallest
fraction. He unravels the web of argument and pieces it together
again; folds it up and lays it aside, that he may examine it more at
his leisure. He hugs indecision to his breast, and takes home a
modest doubt or a nice point to solace himself with it in protracted,
luxurious dalliance. Delay seems, in his mind, to be of the very
essence of justice. He no more hurries through a question than if
no one was waiting for the result, and he was merely a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettanti</span></i>,
fanciful judge, who played at my Lord Chancellor, and busied himself
with quibbles and punctilios as an idle hobby and harmless
illusion. The phlegm of the Chancellor’s disposition gives one
almost a surfeit of impartiality and candour: we are sick of the
eternal poise of childish dilatoriness; and would wish law and
justice to be decided at once by a cast of the dice (as they were in
Rabelais) rather than be kept in frivolous and tormenting suspense.
But there is a limit even to this extreme refinement and scrupulousness
of the Chancellor. The understanding acts only in the absence
of the passions. At the approach of the loadstone, the needle
trembles, and points to it. The air of a political question has a
wonderful tendency to brace and quicken the learned Lord’s faculties.
The breath of a court speedily oversets a thousand objections, and
scatters the cobwebs of his brain. The secret wish of power is a
thumping <em>make-weight</em>, where all is so nicely balanced beforehand.
In the case of a celebrated beauty and heiress, and the brother of a
Noble Lord, the Chancellor hesitated long, and went through the
forms, as usual: but who ever doubted, where all this indecision
would end? No man in his senses, for a single instant! We shall
not press this point, which is rather a ticklish one. Some persons
thought that from entertaining a fellow-feeling on the subject, the
Chancellor would have been ready to favour the Poet-Laureate’s
application to the Court of Chancery for an injunction against Wat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Tyler. His Lordship’s sentiments on such points are not so
variable, he has too much at stake. He recollected the year 1794,
though Mr. Southey had forgotten it!—</p>

<p class='c011'>The personal always prevails over the intellectual, where the
latter is not backed by strong feeling and principle. Where remote
and speculative objects do not excite a predominant interest and
passion, gross and immediate ones are sure to carry the day, even
in ingenuous and well-disposed minds. The will yields necessarily
to some motive or other; and where the public good or distant
consequences excite no sympathy in the breast, either from shortsightedness
or an easiness of temperament that shrinks from any
violent effort or painful emotion, self-interest, indolence, the opinion
of others, a desire to please, the sense of personal obligation, come in
and fill up the void of public spirit, patriotism, and humanity. The
best men in the world in their own natural dispositions or in private
life (for this reason) often become the most dangerous public
characters, from their pliancy to the unruly passions of others, and
from their having no set-off in strong moral <em>stamina</em> to the temptations
that are held out to them, if, as is frequently the case, they are men
of versatile talent or patient industry.—Lord Eldon has one of the
best-natured faces in the world; it is pleasant to meet him in the
street, plodding along with an umbrella under his arm, without one
trace of pride, of spleen, or discontent in his whole demeanour, void
of offence, with almost rustic simplicity and honesty of appearance—a
man that makes friends at first sight, and could hardly make enemies, if
he would; and whose only fault is that he cannot say <em>Nay</em> to power,
or subject himself to an unkind word or look from a King or a Minister.
He is a thorough-bred Tory. Others boggle or are at fault in their
career, or give back at a pinch, they split into different factions, have
various objects to distract them, their private friendships or antipathies
stand in their way; but he has never flinched, never gone
back, never missed his way, he is an <em>out-and-outer</em> in this respect, his
allegiance has been without flaw, like ‘one entire and perfect
chrysolite,’ his implicit understanding is a kind of taffeta-lining
to the Crown, his servility has assumed an air of the most determined
independence, and he has</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Read his history in a Prince’s eyes!’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There has been no stretch of power attempted in his time that he has
not seconded: no existing abuse, so odious or so absurd, that he has
not sanctioned it. He has gone the whole length of the most
unpopular designs of Ministers. When the heavy artillery of interest,
power, and prejudice is brought into the field, the paper pellets of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>brain go for nothing: his labyrinth of nice, lady-like doubts explodes
like a mine of gunpowder. The Chancellor may weigh and palter—the
courtier is decided, the politician is firm, and rivetted to his place
in the Cabinet! On all the great questions that have divided party
opinion or agitated the public mind, the Chancellor has been found
uniformly and without a single exception on the side of prerogative
and power, and against every proposal for the advancement of
freedom. He was a strenuous supporter of the wars and coalitions
against the principles of liberty abroad; he has been equally zealous
in urging or defending every act and infringement of the Constitution,
for abridging it at home: he at the same time opposes every amelioration
of the penal laws, on the alleged ground of his abhorrence of
even the shadow of innovation: he has studiously set his face against
Catholic emancipation; he laboured hard in his vocation to prevent
the abolition of the Slave Trade; he was Attorney-General in the
trials for High Treason in 1794; and the other day in giving his
opinion on the Queen’s Trial, shed tears and protested his innocence
before God! This was natural and to be expected; but on all
occasions he is to be found at his post, true to the call of prejudice, of
power, to the will of others and to his own interest. In the whole
of his public career, and with all the goodness of his disposition, he
has not shown ‘so small a drop of pity as a wren’s eye.’ He seems
to be on his guard against every thing liberal and humane as his weak
side. Others relax in their obsequiousness either from satiety or
disgust, or a hankering after popularity, or a wish to be thought above
narrow prejudices. The Lord Chancellor alone is fixed and immovable.
Is it want of understanding or of principle? No—it is want
of imagination, a phlegmatic habit, an excess of false complaisance
and good-nature. He signs a warrant in Council, devoting ten
thousand men to an untimely death, with steady nerves—Is it that
he is cruel and unfeeling? No!—but he thinks neither of their
sufferings nor their cries; he sees only the gracious smile, the ready
hand stretched out to thank him for his compliance with the dictates
of rooted hate. He dooms a Continent to slavery. Is it that he is a
tyrant, or an enemy to the human race? No!—but he cannot find
in his heart to resist the commands or to give pain to a kind and
generous benefactor. Common sense and justice are little better than
vague terms to him: he acts upon his immediate feelings and least
irksome impulses. The King’s hand is velvet to the touch—the
Woolsack is a seat of honour and profit! That is all he knows
about the matter. As to abstract metaphysical calculations, the ox
that stands staring at the corner of the street troubles his head as much
about them as he does: yet this last is a very good sort of animal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>with no harm or malice in him, unless he is goaded on to mischief, and
then it is necessary to keep out of his way, or warn others against him!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Wilberforce is a less perfect character in his way. He acts
from mixed motives. He would willingly serve two masters, God
and Mammon. He is a person of many excellent and admirable
qualifications, but he has made a mistake in wishing to reconcile
those that are incompatible. He has a most winning eloquence,
specious, persuasive, familiar, silver-tongued, is amiable, charitable,
conscientious, pious, loyal, humane, tractable to power, accessible
to popularity, honouring the king, and no less charmed with
the homage of his fellow-citizens. ‘What lacks he then?’ Nothing
but an economy of good parts. By aiming at too much, he has
spoiled all, and neutralised what might have been an estimable
character, distinguished by signal services to mankind. A man must
take his choice not only between virtue and vice, but between different
virtues. Otherwise, he will not gain his own approbation, or secure
the respect of others. The graces and accomplishments of private
life mar the man of business and the statesman. There is a severity,
a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty required in the
one, which ill-befits the softness and sweetness which should characterise
the other. Loyalty, patriotism, friendship, humanity, are all
virtues; but may they not sometimes clash? By being unwilling to
forego the praise due to any, we may forfeit the reputation of all;
and, instead of uniting the suffrages of the whole world in our favour,
we may end in becoming a sort of by-word for affectation, cant,
hollow professions, trimming, fickleness, and effeminate imbecility.
It is best to choose and act up to some one leading character, as it is
best to have some settled profession or regular pursuit in life.</p>

<p class='c011'>We can readily believe that Mr. Wilberforce’s first object and
principle of action is to do what he thinks right: his next (and that
we fear is of almost equal weight with the first) is to do what will be
thought so by other people. He is always at a game of <em>hawk and
buzzard</em> between these two: his ‘conscience will not budge,’ unless
the world goes with it. He does not seem greatly to dread the
denunciation in Scripture, but rather to court it—‘Woe unto you,
when all men shall speak well of you!’ We suspect he is not quite
easy in his mind, because West-India planters and Guinea traders do
not join in his praise. His ears are not strongly enough tuned to
drink in the execrations of the spoiler and the oppressor as the sweetest
music. It is not enough that one-half of the human species (the
images of God carved in ebony, as old Fuller calls them) shout his
name as a champion and a saviour through vast burning zones, and
moisten their parched lips with the gush of gratitude for deliverance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>from chains—he must have a Prime-Minister drink his health at
a Cabinet-dinner for aiding to rivet on those of his country and of
Europe! He goes hand and heart along with Government in all
their notions of legitimacy and political aggrandizement, in the hope
that they will leave him a sort of <em>no-man’s ground</em> of humanity in the
Great Desert, where his reputation for benevolence and public spirit
may spring up and flourish, till its head touches the clouds, and it
stretches out its branches to the farthest part of the earth. He has
no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much
live-stock on their estates; the country rings with the applause of his
wit, his eloquence, and his indignant appeals to common sense and
humanity on this subject—but not a word has he to say, not a whisper
does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth
over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to
confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. Mr. Wilberforce’s
humanity will go all lengths that it can with safety and discretion:
but it is not to be supposed that it should lose him his seat
for Yorkshire, the smile of Majesty, or the countenance of the loyal
and pious. He is anxious to do all the good he can without hurting
himself or his fair fame. His conscience and his character compound
matters very amicably. He rather patronises honesty than is a martyr
to it. His patriotism, his philanthropy are not so ill-bred, as to
quarrel with his loyalty or to banish him from the first circles. He
preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its
worst abuses in civilized states. He thus shows his respect for
religion without offending the clergy, or circumscribing the sphere of
his usefulness. There is in all this an appearance of a good deal
of cant and tricking. His patriotism may be accused of being servile;
his humanity ostentatious; his loyalty conditional; his religion a
mixture of fashion and fanaticism. ‘Out upon such half-faced fellowship!’
Mr. Wilberforce has the pride of being familiar with the
great; the vanity of being popular; the conceit of an approving
conscience. He is coy in his approaches to power: his public spirit
is, in a manner, <em>under the rose</em>. He thus reaps the credit of independence,
without the obloquy; and secures the advantages of
servility, without incurring any obligations. He has two strings to
his bow:—he by no means neglects his worldly interests, while he
expects a bright reversion in the skies. Mr. Wilberforce is far from
being a hypocrite; but he is, we think, as fine a specimen of <em>moral
equivocation</em> as can well be conceived. A hypocrite is one who is the
very reverse of, or who despises the character he pretends to be:
Mr. Wilberforce would be all that he pretends to be, and he is it in
fact, as far as words, plausible theories, good inclinations, and easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>services go, but not in heart and soul, or so as to give up the
appearance of any one of his pretensions to preserve the reality of any
other. He carefully chooses his ground to fight the battles of loyalty,
religion, and humanity, and it is such as is always safe and advantageous
to himself! This is perhaps hardly fair, and it is of dangerous
or doubtful tendency. Lord Eldon, for instance, is known to be a
thorough-paced ministerialist: his opinion is only that of his party.
But Mr. Wilberforce is not a party-man. He is the more looked up
to on this account, but not with sufficient reason. By tampering with
different temptations and personal projects, he has all the air of the
most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and
candour, when he is only striking a balance in his mind between the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> of differing from a Minister on some ‘vantage ground, and the
risk or odium that may attend it. He carries all the weight of his
artificial popularity over to the Government on vital points and hardrun
questions; while they, in return, lend him a little of the gilding
of court-favour to set off his disinterested philanthropy and tramontane
enthusiasm. As a leader or a follower, he makes an odd jumble of
interests. By virtue of religious sympathy, he has brought the Saints
over to the side of the abolition of Negro slavery. This his
adversaries think hard and stealing a march upon them. What have
the <span class='sc'>Saints</span> to do with freedom or reform of any kind?—Mr. Wilberforce’s
style of speaking is not quite <em>parliamentary</em>, it is halfway
between that and <em>evangelical</em>. He is altogether a <em>double-entendre</em>: the
very tone of his voice is a <em>double-entendre</em>. It winds, and undulates,
and glides up and down on texts of Scriptures, and scraps from Paley,
and trite sophistry, and pathetic appeals to his hearers in a faltering,
in-progressive, side-long way, like those birds of weak wing, that are
borne from their strait-forward course</p>

<p class='c015'>Something of this fluctuating, time-serving principle was visible even
in the great question of the Abolition of the Slave Trade. He was,
at one time, half inclined to surrender it into Mr. Pitt’s dilatory
hands, and seemed to think the gloss of novelty was gone from it,
and the gaudy colouring of popularity sunk into the <em>sable</em> ground from
which it rose! It was, however, persisted in and carried to a
triumphant conclusion. Mr. Wilberforce said too little on this
occasion of one, compared with whom he was but the frontispiece
to that great chapter in the history of the world—the mask, the
varnishing, and painting—the man that effected it by Herculean
labours of body, and equally gigantic labours of mind, was Clarkson,
the true Apostle of human Redemption on that occasion, and who, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>is remarkable, resembles in his person and lineaments more than one
of the Apostles in the <cite>Cartoons</cite> of Raphael. He deserves to be
added to the Twelve!<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. COBBETT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>People have about as substantial an idea of Cobbett as they have of
Cribb. His blows are as hard, and he himself is as impenetrable.
One has no notion of him as making use of a fine pen, but a great
mutton-fist; his style stuns his readers, and he ‘fillips the ear of the
public with a three-man beetle.’ He is too much for any single
newspaper antagonist; ‘lays waste’ a city orator or Member of
Parliament, and bears hard upon the Government itself. He is
a kind of <em>fourth estate</em> in the politics of the country. He is not only
unquestionably the most powerful political writer of the present day,
but one of the best writers in the language. He speaks and thinks
plain, broad, downright English. He might be said to have the
clearness of Swift, the naturalness of Defoe, and the picturesque
satirical description of Mandeville; if all such comparisons were not
impertinent. A really great and original writer is like nobody but
himself. In one sense, Sterne was not a wit, nor Shakespear a poet.
It is easy to describe second-rate talents, because they fall into a class
and enlist under a standard: but first-rate powers defy calculation or
comparison, and can be defined only by themselves. They are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui
generis</span></i>, and make the class to which they belong. I have tried
half-a-dozen times to describe Burke’s style without ever succeeding;—its
severe extravagance; its literal boldness; its matter-of-fact
hyperboles; its running away with a subject, and from it at the same
time—but there is no making it out, for there is no example of the
same thing any where else. We have no common measure to refer
to; and his qualities contradict even themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cobbett is not so difficult. He has been compared to Paine; and
so far it is true there are no two writers who come more into
juxtaposition from the nature of their subjects, from the internal
resources on which they draw, and from the popular effect of their
writings and their adaptation (though that is a bad word in the
present case) to the capacity of every reader. But still if we turn to
a volume of Paine’s (his Common Sense or Rights of Man) we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>struck (not to say somewhat refreshed) by the difference. Paine is
a much more sententious writer than Cobbett. You cannot open
a page in any of his best and earlier works without meeting with
some maxim, some antithetical and memorable saying, which is a sort
of starting-place for the argument, and the goal to which it returns.
There is not a single <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mot</span></i>, a single sentence in Cobbett that has
ever been quoted again. If any thing is ever quoted from him, it is
an epithet of abuse or a nickname. He is an excellent hand at
invention in that way, and has ‘damnable iteration in him.’ What
could be better than his pestering Erskine year after year with his
second title of Baron Clackmannan? He is rather too fond of such
phrases as <em>the Sons and Daughters of Corruption</em>. Paine affected to
reduce things to first principles, to announce self-evident truths.
Cobbett troubles himself about little but the details and local circumstances.
The first appeared to have made up his mind beforehand to
certain opinions, and to try to find the most compendious and pointed
expressions for them: his successor appears to have no clue, no fixed
or leading principles, nor ever to have thought on a question till he
sits down to write about it: but then there seems no end of his
matters of fact and raw materials, which are brought out in all their
strength and sharpness from not having been squared or frittered down
or vamped up to suit a theory—he goes on with his descriptions and
illustrations as if he would never come to a stop; they have all the
force of novelty with all the familiarity of old acquaintance; his
knowledge grows out of the subject, and his style is that of a man
who has an absolute intuition of what he is talking about, and never
thinks of any thing else. He deals in premises and speaks to
evidence—the coming to a conclusion and summing up (which was
Paine’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>) lies in a smaller compass. The one could not compose
an elementary treatise on politics to become a manual for the popular
reader; nor could the other in all probability have kept up a weekly
journal for the same number of years with the same spirit, interest,
and untired perseverance. Paine’s writings are a sort of introduction
to political arithmetic on a new plan: Cobbett keeps a day-book, and
makes an entry at full of all the occurrences and troublesome
questions that start up throughout the year. Cobbett, with vast
industry, vast information, and the utmost power of making what he
says intelligible, never seems to get at the beginning or come to the
end of any question: Paine in a few short sentences seems by his
peremptory manner ‘to clear it from all controversy, past, present,
and to come.’ Paine takes a bird’s-eye view of things.—Cobbett
sticks close to them, inspects the component parts, and keeps fast hold
of the smallest advantages they afford him. Or if I might here be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>indulged in a pastoral allusion, Paine tries to enclose his ideas in a
fold for security and repose; Cobbett lets <em>his</em> pour out upon the plain
like a flock of sheep to feed and batten. Cobbett is a pleasanter
writer for those to read who do not agree with him; for he is less
dogmatical, goes more into the common grounds of fact and argument
to which all appeal, is more desultory and various, and appears less to
be driving at a previous conclusion than urged on by the force of
present conviction. He is therefore tolerated by all parties, though
he has made himself by turns obnoxious to all; and even those he
abuses read him. The Reformers read him when he was a Tory,
and the Tories read him now that he is a Reformer. He must,
I think, however, be <em>caviare</em> to the Whigs.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>If he is less metaphysical and poetical than his celebrated prototype,
he is more picturesque and dramatic. His episodes, which are
numerous as they are pertinent, are striking, interesting, full of life
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, minute, double measure running over, but never tedious—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nunquam
sufflaminandus erat</span></i>. He is one of those writers who can
never tire us—not even of himself; and the reason is, he is always
‘full of matter.’ He never runs to lees, never gives us the vapid
leavings of himself, is never ‘weary, stale, and unprofitable,’ but
always setting out afresh on his journey, clearing away some old
nuisance, and turning up new mould. His egotism is delightful,
for there is no affectation in it. He does not talk of himself for
lack of something to write about, but because some circumstance
that has happened to himself is the best possible illustration of the
subject, and he is not the man to shrink from giving the best possible
illustration of the subject from a squeamish delicacy. He likes both
himself and his subject too well. He does not put himself before it,
and say ‘admire me first’; but places us in the same situation with
himself, and makes us see all that he does. There is no blindman’s
buff, no conscious hints, no awkward ventriloquism, no testimonies
of applause, no abstract, senseless self-complacency, no smuggled
admiration of his own person by proxy; it is all plain and above-board.
He writes himself plain William Cobbett, strips himself
quite as naked as any body could wish—in a word, his egotism is
full of individuality, and has room for very little vanity in it. We
feel delighted, rub our hands, and draw our chair to the fire, when
we come to a passage of this sort: we know it will be something
new and good, manly and simple, not the same insipid story of self
over again. We sit down at table with the writer, but it is of a
course of rich viands—flesh, fish, and wild fowl—and not to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>nominal entertainment, like that given to Barmecide in the Arabian
Nights, who put off his visitors with calling for a number of exquisite
things that never appeared, and with the honour of his company.
Mr. Cobbett is not a <em>make-believe</em> writer. His worst enemy cannot
say that of him. Still less is he a vulgar one. He must be a puny
common-place critic indeed, who thinks him so. How fine were the
graphical descriptions he sent us from America: what a transatlantic
flavour, what a native <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>, what a fine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauce piquante</span></i> of contempt
they were seasoned with! If he had sat down to look at himself
in the glass, instead of looking about him like Adam in Paradise,
he would not have got up these articles in so capital a style. What
a noble account of his first breakfast after his arrival in America!
It might serve for a month. There is no scene on the stage more
amusing. How well he paints the gold and scarlet plumage of the
American birds, only to lament more pathetically the want of the wild
wood-notes of his native land! The groves of the Ohio that had
just fallen beneath the axe’s stroke, ‘live in his description,’ and the
turnips that he transplanted from Botley ‘look green’ in prose!
How well at another time he describes the poor sheep that had got
the tick, and had tumbled down in the agonies of death! It is
a portrait in the manner of Bewick, with the strength, the simplicity,
and feeling of that great naturalist. What havoc he makes, when he
pleases, of the curls of Dr. Parr’s wig and of the Whig consistency
of Mr. ——! His Grammar, too, is as entertaining as a storybook.
He is too hard, however, upon the style of others, and not
enough (sometimes) on his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a political partisan, no one can stand against him. With his
brandished club, like Giant Despair in the Pilgrim’s Progress, he
knocks out their brains: and not only no individual, but no corrupt
system, could hold out against his powerful and repeated attacks;
but with the same weapon, swung round like a flail, with which he
levels his antagonists, he lays his friends low, and puts his own party
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i>. This is a bad propensity, and a worse principle in
political tactics, though a common one. If his blows were straight
forward and steadily directed to the same object, no unpopular
minister could live before him; instead of which he lays about right
and left, impartially and remorselessly, makes a clear stage, has all
the ring to himself, and then runs out of it, just when he should
stand his ground. He throws his head into his adversary’s stomach,
and takes away from him all inclination for the fight, hits fair or
foul, strikes at every thing, and as you come up to his aid or stand
ready to pursue his advantage, trips up your heels or lays you sprawling,
and pummels you when down as much to his heart’s content as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>ever the Yanguesian carriers belaboured Rosinante with their packstaves.
‘<em>He has the back-trick simply the best of any man in Illyria.</em>’
He pays off both scores of old friendship and new-acquired enmity
in a breath, in one perpetual volley, one raking fire of ‘arrowy sleet’
shot from his pen. However his own reputation or the cause may
suffer in consequence, he cares not one pin about that, so that he
disables all who oppose or who pretend to help him. In fact, he
cannot bear success of any kind, not even of his own views or party;
and if any principle were likely to become popular, would turn round
against it, to show his power, in shouldering it on one side. In
short, wherever power is, there is he against it; he naturally butts
at all obstacles, as unicorns are attracted to oak-trees, and feels his
own strength only by resistance to the opinions and wishes of the
rest of the world. To sail with the stream, to agree with the
company, is not his humour. If he could bring about a Reform in
Parliament, the odds are that he would instantly fall foul of and try
to mar his own handy-work; and he quarrels with his own creatures
as soon as he has written them into a little vogue—and a prison.
I do not think this is vanity or fickleness so much as a pugnacious
disposition, that must have an antagonist power to contend with,
and only finds itself at ease in systematic opposition. If it were
not for this, the high towers and rotten places of the world would
fall before the battering-ram of his hard-headed reasoning: but if he
once found them tottering, he would apply his strength to prop them
up, and disappoint the expectations of his followers. He cannot
agree to any thing established, nor to set up any thing else in its
stead. While it is established, he presses hard against it, because it
presses upon him, at least in imagination. Let it crumble under his
grasp, and the motive to resistance is gone. He then requires some
other grievance to set his face against. His principle is repulsion,
his nature contradiction: he is made up of mere antipathies; an
Ishmaelite indeed, without a fellow. He is always playing at <em>hunt-the-slipper</em>
in politics. He turns round upon whoever is next to him.
The way to wean him from any opinion, and make him conceive
an intolerable hatred against it, would be to place somebody near
him who was perpetually dinning it in his ears. When he is in
England, he does nothing but abuse the Boroughmongers, and laugh
at the whole system: when he is in America, he grows impatient of
freedom and a republic. If he had staid there a little longer, he
would have become a loyal and a loving subject of his Majesty King
George IV. He lampooned the French Revolution when it was
hailed as the dawn of liberty by millions: by the time it was brought
into almost universal ill-odour by some means or other (partly no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>doubt by himself) he had turned, with one or two or three others,
staunch Bonapartist. He is always of the militant, not of the
triumphant party: so far he bears a gallant show of magnanimity;
but his gallantry is hardly of the right stamp: it wants principle.
For though he is not servile or mercenary, he is the victim of self-will.
He must pull down and pull in pieces: it is not in his
disposition to do otherwise. It is a pity; for with his great talents
he might do great things, if he would go right forward to any useful
object, make thorough-stitch work of any question, or join hand and
heart with any principle. He changes his opinions as he does his
friends, and much on the same account. He has no comfort in fixed
principles: as soon as any thing is settled in his own mind, he quarrels
with it. He has no satisfaction but in the chase after truth, runs
a question down, worries and kills it, then quits it like vermin, and
starts some new game, to lead him a new dance, and give him a
fresh breathing through bog and brake, with the rabble yelping at
his heels and the leaders perpetually at fault. This he calls sport-royal.
He thinks it as good as cudgel-playing or single-stick, or any
thing else that has life in it. He likes the cut and thrust, the falls,
bruises, and dry blows of an argument: as to any good or useful
results that may come of the amicable settling of it, any one is
welcome to them for him. The amusement is over, when the matter
is once fairly decided.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another point of view in which this may be put. I might
say that Mr. Cobbett is a very honest man, with a total want of
principle; and I might explain this paradox thus, I mean that he
is, I think, in downright earnest in what he says, in the part he takes
at the time; but in taking that part, he is led entirely by headstrong
obstinacy, caprice, novelty, pique or personal motive of some sort,
and not by a steadfast regard for truth or habitual anxiety for what
is right uppermost in his mind. He is not a feed, time-serving,
shuffling advocate (no man could write as he does who did not
believe himself sincere)—but his understanding is the dupe and slave
of his momentary, violent, and irritable humours. He does not
adopt an opinion ‘deliberately or for money’; yet his conscience
is at the mercy of the first provocation he receives, of the first whim
he takes in his head; he sees things through the medium of heat
and passion, not with reference to any general principles, and his
whole system of thinking is deranged by the first object that strikes
his fancy or sours his temper.—One cause of this phenomenon is
perhaps his want of a regular education. He is a self-taught man,
and has the faults as well as excellences of that class of persons in
their most striking and glaring excess. It must be acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>that the Editor of the Political Register (the <em>two-penny trash</em>, as it
was called, till a Bill passed the House to raise the price to sixpence)
is not ‘the gentleman and scholar:’ though he has qualities that,
with a little better management, would be worth (to the public)
both those titles. For want of knowing what has been discovered
before him, he has not certain general landmarks to refer to, or a
general standard of thought to apply to individual cases. He relies
on his own acuteness and the immediate evidence, without being
acquainted with the comparative anatomy or philosophical structure
of opinion. He does not view things on a large scale or at the
horizon (dim and airy enough perhaps); but as they affect himself,—close,
palpable, tangible. Whatever he finds out is his own, and
he only knows what he finds out. He is in the constant hurry and
fever of gestation: his brain teems incessantly with some fresh
project. Every new light is the birth of a new system, the dawn
of a new world to him. He is continually outstripping and overreaching
himself. The last opinion is the only true one. He is
wiser to-day than he was yesterday. Why should he not be wiser
to-morrow than he was to-day?—Men of a learned education are
not so sharp-witted as clever men without it; but they know the
balance of the human intellect better: if they are more stupid, they
are more steady; and are less liable to be led astray by their own
sagacity and the over-weening petulance of hard-earned and late-acquired
wisdom. They do not fall in love with every meretricious
extravagance at first sight, or mistake an old battered hypothesis for
a vestal, because they are new to the ways of this old world. They
do not seize upon it as a prize, but are safe from gross imposition by
being as wise and no wiser than those who went before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paine said on some occasion, ‘What I have written, I have
written’—as rendering any farther declaration of his principles
unnecessary. Not so Mr. Cobbett. What he has written is no rule
to him what he is to write. He learns something every day, and
every week he takes the field to maintain the opinions of the last six
days against friend or foe. I doubt whether this outrageous inconsistency,
this headstrong fickleness, this understood want of all rule
and method, does not enable him to go on with the spirit, vigour, and
variety that he does. He is not pledged to repeat himself. Every
new Register is a kind of new Prospectus. He blesses himself from
all ties and shackles on his understanding; he has no mortgages on
his brain; his notions are free and unincumbered. If he was put in
trammels, he might become a vile hack like so many more. But he
gives himself ‘ample scope and verge enough.’ He takes both sides
of a question, and maintains one as sturdily as the other. If nobody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>else can argue against him, he is a very good match for himself. He
writes better in favour of reform than any body else; he used to
write better against it. Wherever he is, there is the tug of war, the
weight of the argument, the strength of abuse. He is not like a man
in danger of being <em>bed-rid</em> in his faculties—he tosses and tumbles
about his unwieldy bulk, and when he is tired of lying on one side,
relieves himself by turning on the other. His shifting his point of
view from time to time not merely adds variety and greater comforts
to his topics (so that the Political Register is an armoury and
magazine for all the materials and weapons of political warfare), but
it gives a greater zest and liveliness to his manner of treating them.
Mr. Cobbett takes nothing for granted, as what he has proved before;
he does not write a book of reference. We see his ideas in their
first concoction, fermenting and overflowing with the ebullitions of a
lively conception. We look on at the actual process, and are put in
immediate possession of the grounds and materials on which he forms
his sanguine, unsettled conclusions. He does not give us samples of
reasoning, but the whole solid mass, refuse and all.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘He pours out all as plain</div>
      <div class='line'>As downright Shippen or as old Montaigne.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This is one cause of the clearness and force of his writings. An
argument does not stop to stagnate and muddle in his brain, but passes
at once to his paper. His ideas are served up, like pancakes, hot and
hot. Fresh theories give him fresh courage. He is like a young
and lusty bridegroom, that divorces a favourite speculation every
morning, and marries a new one every night. He is not wedded to
his notions, not he. He has not one Mrs. Cobbett among all his
opinions. He makes the most of the last thought that has come in
his way, seizes fast hold of it, rumples it about in all directions with
rough strong hands, has his wicked will of it, takes a surfeit, and
throws it away.—Our author’s changing his opinions for new ones is
not so wonderful; what is more remarkable is his felicity in forgetting
his old ones. He does not pretend to consistency (like Mr.
Coleridge); he frankly disavows all connexion with himself. He
feels no personal responsibility in this way, and cuts a friend or
principle with the same decided indifference that Antipholis of
Ephesus cuts Ægeon of Syracuse. It is a hollow thing. The only
time he ever grew romantic was in bringing over the relics of
Mr. Thomas Paine with him from America, to go a progress with
them through the disaffected districts. Scarce had he landed in
Liverpool, when he left the bones of a great man to shift for themselves;
and no sooner did he arrive in London, than he made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>speech to disclaim all participation in the political and theological
sentiments of his late idol, and to place the whole stock of his
admiration and enthusiasm towards him to the account of his financial
speculations, and of his having predicted the fate of paper-money. If
he had erected a little gold statue to him, it might have proved the
sincerity of this assertion: but to make a martyr and a patron-saint of
a man, and to dig up ‘his canonized bones’ in order to expose them
as objects of devotion to the rabble’s gaze, asks something that has
more life and spirit in it, more mind and vivifying soul, than has to do
with any calculation of pounds, shillings, and pence! The fact is, he
<em>ratted</em> from his own project. He found the thing not so ripe as he
had expected. His heart failed him: his enthusiasm fled, and he
made his retraction. His admiration is short-lived: his contempt
only is rooted, and his resentment lasting.—The above was only one
instance of his building too much on practical <em>data</em>. He has an ill
habit of prophesying, and goes on, though still deceived. The art
of prophesying does not suit Mr. Cobbett’s style. He has a knack
of fixing names and times and places. According to him, the
Reformed Parliament was to meet in March, 1818: it did not, and
we heard no more of the matter. When his predictions fail, he takes
no farther notice of them, but applies himself to new ones—like the
country-people, who turn to see what weather there is in the almanac
for the next week, though it has been out in its reckoning every day
of the last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Cobbett is great in attack, not in defence: he cannot fight an
up-hill battle. He will not bear the least punishing. If any one
turns upon him (which few people like to do), he immediately turns
tail. Like an overgrown school-boy, he is so used to have it all his
own way, that he cannot submit to any thing like competition, or a
struggle for the mastery: he must lay on all the blows, and take
none. He is bullying and cowardly; a Big Ben in politics, who will
fall upon others and crush them by his weight, but is not prepared for
resistance, and is soon staggered by a few smart blows. Whenever
he has been set upon, he has slunk out of the controversy. The
Edinburgh Review made (what is called) a dead set at him some
years ago, to which he only retorted by an eulogy on the superior
neatness of an English kitchen-garden to a Scotch one. I remember
going one day into a bookseller’s shop in Fleet-street to ask for the
Review; and on my expressing my opinion to a young Scotchman,
who stood behind the counter, that Mr. Cobbett might hit as hard in
his reply, the North Briton said with some alarm—‘But you don’t
think, Sir, Mr. Cobbett will be able to injure the Scottish nation?’
I said I could not speak to that point, but I thought he was very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>able to defend himself. He however did not, but has born a grudge
to the Edinburgh Review ever since, which he hates worse than the
Quarterly. I cannot say I do.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c003'>MR. CAMPBELL AND MR. CRABBE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Campbell may be said to hold a place (among modern poets)
between Lord Byron and Mr. Rogers. With much of the glossy
splendour, the pointed vigour, and romantic interest of the one, he
possesses the fastidious refinement, the classic elegance of the other.
Mr. Rogers, as a writer, is too effeminate, Lord Byron too extravagant:
Mr. Campbell is neither. The author of the <cite>Pleasures of
Memory</cite> polishes his lines till they sparkle with the most exquisite
finish; he attenuates them into the utmost degree of trembling
softness: but we may complain, in spite of the delicacy and brilliancy
of the execution, of a want of strength and solidity. The author of
the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>, with a richer and deeper vein of thought and
imagination, works it out into figures of equal grace and dazzling
beauty, avoiding on the one hand the tinsel of flimsy affectation, and
on the other the vices of a rude and barbarous negligence. His
Pegasus is not a rough, skittish colt, running wild among the mountains,
covered with bur-docks and thistles, nor a tame, sleek pad,
unable to get out of the same ambling pace; but a beautiful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manège</span></i>
horse, full of life and spirit in itself, and subject to the complete
controul of the rider. Mr. Campbell gives scope to his feelings and
his fancy, and embodies them in a noble and naturally interesting
subject; and he at the same time conceives himself called upon
(in these days of critical nicety) to pay the exact attention to the
expression of each thought, and to modulate each line into the most
faultless harmony. The character of his mind is a lofty and self-scrutinising
ambition, that strives to reconcile the integrity of general
design with the perfect elaboration of each component part, that aims
at striking effect, but is jealous of the means by which this is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>produced. Our poet is not averse to popularity (nay, he is tremblingly
alive to it)—but self-respect is the primary law, the indispensable
condition on which it must be obtained. We should dread to point
out (even if we could) a false concord, a mixed metaphor, an
imperfect rhyme, in any of Mr. Campbell’s productions; for we
think that all his fame would hardly compensate to him for the
discovery. He seeks for perfection, and nothing evidently short of it
can satisfy his mind. He is a <em>high finisher</em> in poetry, whose every
work must bear inspection, whose slightest touch is precious—not a
coarse dauber, who is contented to impose on public wonder and
credulity by some huge, ill-executed design, or who endeavours to
wear out patience and opposition together by a load of lumbering,
feeble, awkward, improgressive lines—on the contrary, Mr. Campbell
labours to lend every grace of execution to his subject, while he
borrows his ardour and inspiration from it, and to deserve the laurels
he has earned, by true genius and by true pains. There is an
apparent consciousness of this in most of his writings. He has
attained to great excellence by aiming at the greatest, by a cautious
and yet daring selection of topics, and by studiously (and with a
religious horror) avoiding all those faults which arise from grossness,
vulgarity, haste, and disregard of public opinion. He seizes on the
highest point of eminence, and strives to keep it to himself—he
‘snatches a grace beyond the reach of art,’ and will not let it go—he
steeps a single thought or image so deep in the Tyrian dyes
of a gorgeous imagination, that it throws its lustre over a whole page—every
where vivid <em>ideal</em> forms hover (in intense conception) over
the poet’s verse, which ascends, like the aloe, to the clouds, with
pure flowers at its top. Or, to take an humbler comparison (the pride
of genius must sometimes stoop to the lowliness of criticism), Mr.
Campbell’s poetry often reminds us of the purple gilliflower, both for
its colour and its scent, its glowing warmth, its rich, languid, sullen hue,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yet sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Cytherea’s breath!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are those who complain of the little that Mr. Campbell has
done in poetry, and who seem to insinuate that he is deterred by his
own reputation from making any farther or higher attempts. But
after having produced two poems that have gone to the heart of a
nation, and are gifts to a world, he may surely linger out the rest of
his life in a dream of immortality. There are moments in our lives
so exquisite that all that remains of them afterwards seems useless and
barren; and there are lines and stanzas in our author’s early writings
in which he may be thought to have exhausted all the sweetness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>all the essence of poetry, so that nothing farther was left to his efforts
or his ambition. Happy is it for those few and fortunate worshippers
of the Muse (not a subject of grudging or envy to others) who
already enjoy in their life-time a foretaste of their future fame, who
see their names accompanying them, like a cloud of glory, from youth
to age,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And by the vision splendid,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are on their way attended’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and who know that they have built a shrine for the thoughts and
feelings that were most dear to them, in the minds and memories of
other men, till the language which they lisped in childhood is
forgotten, or the human heart shall beat no more!</p>

<p class='c011'>The <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite> alone would not have called forth these
remarks from us; but there are passages in the <cite>Gertrude of Wyoming</cite>
of so rare and ripe a beauty, that they challenge, as they exceed all
praise. Such, for instance, is the following peerless description of
Gertrude’s childhood:-</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘A loved bequest,—and I may half impart</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To those that feel the strong paternal tie,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How like a new existence to his heart</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That living flow’r uprose beneath his eye,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dear as she was from cherub infancy,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From hours when she would round his garden play,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To time when as the rip’ning years went by,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her lovely mind could culture well repay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And more engaging grew, from pleasing day to day.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘I may not paint those thousand infant charms;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(Unconscious fascination, undesign’d!)</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The orison repeated in his arms,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For God to bless her sire and all mankind;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The book, the bosom on his knee reclined,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or how sweet fairy-lore he heard her con,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(The playmate ere the teacher of her mind):</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All uncompanion’d else her heart had gone</div>
      <div class='line'>Till now, in Gertrude’s eyes, their ninth blue summer shone.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘And summer was the tide, and sweet the hour,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When sire and daughter saw, with fleet descent,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Of buskin’d limb and swarthy lineament;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The red wild feathers on his brow were blent,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Of Christian vesture and complexion bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Led by his dusky guide, like morning brought by night.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>In the foregoing stanzas we particularly admire the line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Till now, in Gertrude’s eyes, their ninth blue summer shone.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It appears to us like the ecstatic union of natural beauty and poetic
fancy, and in its playful sublimity resembles the azure canopy mirrored
in the smiling waters, bright, liquid, serene, heavenly! A great
outcry, we know, has prevailed for some time past against poetic
diction and affected conceits, and, to a certain degree, we go along
with it; but this must not prevent us from feeling the thrill of pleasure
when we see beauty linked to beauty, like kindred flame to flame, or
from applauding the voluptuous fancy that raises and adorns the fairy
fabric of thought, that nature has begun! Pleasure is ‘scattered in
stray-gifts o’er the earth’—beauty streaks the ‘famous poet’s page’
in occasional lines of inconceivable brightness; and wherever this is
the case, no splenetic censures or ‘jealous leer malign,’ no idle
theories or cold indifference should hinder us from greeting it with
rapture. There are other parts of this poem equally delightful, in
which there is a light startling as the red-bird’s wing; a perfume like
that of the magnolia; a music like the murmuring of pathless woods
or of the everlasting ocean. We conceive, however, that Mr.
Campbell excels chiefly in sentiment and imagery. The story moves
slow, and is mechanically conducted, and rather resembles a Scotch
canal carried over lengthened aqueducts and with a number of <em>locks</em> in
it, than one of those rivers that sweep in their majestic course, broad
and full, over Transatlantic plains and lose themselves in rolling gulfs,
or thunder down lofty precipices. But in the centre, the inmost
recesses of our poet’s heart, the pearly dew of sensibility is distilled
and collects, like the diamond in the mine, and the structure of his
fame rests on the crystal columns of a polished imagination. We
prefer the <cite>Gertrude</cite> to the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>, because with perhaps
less brilliancy, there is more of tenderness and natural imagery in the
former. In the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite> Mr. Campbell had not completely
emancipated himself from the trammels of the more artificial style of
poetry—from epigram, and antithesis, and hyperbole. The best line
in it, in which earthly joys are said to be—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like angels’ visits, few and far between’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>is a borrowed one.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a> But in the Gertrude of Wyoming ‘we perceive
a softness coming over the heart of the author, and the scales and
crust of formality, that fence in his couplets and give them a somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>glittering and rigid appearance, fall off,’ and he has succeeded
in engrafting the wild and more expansive interest of the romantic
school of poetry on classic elegance and precision. After the poem
we have just named, Mr. Campbell’s Songs are the happiest efforts of
his Muse:—breathing freshness, blushing like the morn, they seem,
like clustering roses, to weave a chaplet for love and liberty; or their
bleeding words gush out in mournful and hurried succession, like
‘ruddy drops that visit the sad heart’ of thoughtful Humanity. The
<cite>Battle of Hohenlinden</cite> is of all modern compositions the most lyrical in
spirit and in sound. To justify this encomium, we need only recall
the lines to the reader’s memory.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Campbell’s prose-criticisms on contemporary and other poets
(which have appeared in the New Monthly Magazine) are in a style
at once chaste, temperate, guarded, and just.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Crabbe presents an entire contrast to Mr. Campbell:—The
one is the most ambitious and aspiring of living poets, the other the
most humble and prosaic. If the poetry of the one is like the arch
of the rainbow, spanning and adorning the earth, that of the other is
like a dull, leaden cloud hanging over it. Mr. Crabbe’s style might
be cited as an answer to Audrey’s question—‘Is poetry a true thing?’
There are here no ornaments, no flights of fancy, no illusions of
sentiment, no tinsel of words. His song is one sad reality, one
unraised, unvaried note of unavailing woe. Literal fidelity serves
him in the place of invention; he assumes importance by a number of
petty details; he rivets attention by being tedious. He not only
deals in incessant matters of fact, but in matters of fact of the most
familiar, the least animating, and the most unpleasant kind; but he
relies for the effect of novelty on the microscopic minuteness with
which he dissects the most trivial objects—and for the interest he
excites, on the unshrinking determination with which he handles the
most painful. His poetry has an official and professional air. He is
called in to cases of difficult births, of fractured limbs, or breaches of
the peace; and makes out a parochial list of accidents and offences.
He takes the most trite, the most gross and obvious and revolting part
of nature, for the subject of his elaborate descriptions; but it is Nature
still, and Nature is a great and mighty Goddess! It is well for the
Reverend Author that it is so. Individuality is, in his theory, the
only definition of poetry. Whatever <em>is</em>, he hitches into rhyme.
Whoever makes an exact image of any thing on the earth, however
deformed or insignificant, according to him, must succeed—and he
himself has succeeded. Mr. Crabbe is one of the most popular and
admired of our living authors. That he is so, can be accounted for
on no other principle than the strong ties that bind us to the world
about us, and our involuntary yearnings after whatever in any manner
powerfully and directly reminds us of it. His Muse is not one of <em>the
Daughters of Memory</em>, but the old toothless, mumbling, dame herself,
doling out the gossip and scandal of the neighbourhood, recounting
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">totidem verbis et literis</span></i>, what happens in every place of the kingdom
every hour in the year, and fastening always on the worst as the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>palatable morsels. But she is a circumstantial old lady, communicative,
scrupulous, leaving nothing to the imagination, harping on the
smallest grievances, a village oracle and critic, most veritable, most
identical, bringing us acquainted with persons and things just as they
chanced to exist, and giving us a local interest in all she knows and
tells. Mr. Crabbe’s Helicon is choked up with weeds and corruption;
it reflects no light from heaven, it emits no cheerful sound: no flowers
of love, of hope, or joy spring up near it, or they bloom only to
wither in a moment. Our poet’s verse does not put a spirit of youth
in every thing, but a spirit of fear, despondency, and decay: it is not
an electric spark to kindle or expand, but acts like the torpedo’s touch
to deaden or contract. It lends no dazzling tints to fancy, it aids no
soothing feelings in the heart, it gladdens no prospect, it stirs no wish;
in its view the current of life runs slow, dull, cold, dispirited, half
under ground, muddy, and clogged with all creeping things. The
world is one vast infirmary; the hill of Parnassus is a penitentiary, of
which our author is the overseer: to read him is a penance, yet we
read on! Mr. Crabbe, it must be confessed, is a repulsive writer.
He contrives to ‘turn diseases to commodities,’ and makes a virtue of
necessity. He puts us out of conceit with this world, which perhaps
a severe divine should do; yet does not, as a charitable divine ought,
point to another. His morbid feelings droop and cling to the earth,
grovel where they should soar; and throw a dead weight on every
aspiration of the soul after the good or beautiful. By degrees we
submit, and are reconciled to our fate, like patients to the physician,
or prisoners in the condemned cell. We can only explain this by
saying, as we said before, that Mr. Crabbe gives us one part of nature,
the mean, the little, the disgusting, the distressing; that he does this
thoroughly and like a master, and we forgive all the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Crabbe’s first poems were published so long ago as the year
1782, and received the approbation of Dr. Johnson only a little before
he died. This was a testimony from an enemy; for Dr. Johnson
was not an admirer of the simple in style or minute in description.
Still he was an acute, strong-minded man, and could see truth when it
was presented to him, even through the mist of his prejudices and his
foibles. There was something in Mr. Crabbe’s intricate points that
did not, after all, so ill accord with the Doctor’s purblind vision; and
he knew quite enough of the petty ills of life to judge of the merit of
our poet’s descriptions, though he himself chose to slur them over in
high-sounding dogmas or general invectives. Mr. Crabbe’s earliest
poem of the <cite>Village</cite> was recommended to the notice of Dr. Johnson
by Sir Joshua Reynolds; and we cannot help thinking that a taste for
that sort of poetry, which leans for support on the truth and fidelity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>of its imitations of nature, began to display itself much about that time,
and, in a good measure, in consequence of the direction of the public
taste to the subject of painting. Book-learning, the accumulation of
wordy common-places, the gaudy pretensions of poetical fiction, had
enfeebled and perverted our eye for nature. The study of the fine
arts, which came into fashion about forty years ago, and was then
first considered as a polite accomplishment, would tend imperceptibly
to restore it. Painting is essentially an imitative art; it cannot
subsist for a moment on empty generalities: the critic, therefore, who
had been used to this sort of substantial entertainment, would be
disposed to read poetry with the eye of a connoisseur, would be
little captivated with smooth, polished, unmeaning periods, and would
turn with double eagerness and relish to the force and precision of
individual details, transferred, as it were, to the page from the canvas.
Thus an admirer of Teniers or Hobbima might think little of the
pastoral sketches of Pope or Goldsmith; even Thomson describes
not so much the naked object as what he sees in his mind’s eye,
surrounded and glowing with the mild, bland, genial vapours of his
brain:—but the adept in Dutch interiors, hovels, and pig-styes must
find in Mr. Crabbe a man after his own heart. He is the very thing
itself; he paints in words, instead of colours: there is no other
difference. As Mr. Crabbe is not a painter, only because he does not
use a brush and colours, so he is for the most part a poet, only
because he writes in lines of ten syllables. All the rest might be
found in a newspaper, an old magazine, or a county-register. Our
author is himself a little jealous of the prudish fidelity of his homely
Muse, and tries to justify himself by precedents. He brings as a
parallel instance of merely literal description, Pope’s lines on the gay
Duke of Buckingham, beginning ‘In the worst inn’s worst room see
Villiers lies!’ But surely nothing can be more dissimilar. Pope
describes what is striking, Crabbe would have described merely what
was there. The objects in Pope stand out to the fancy from the
mixture of the mean with the gaudy, from the contrast of the scene and
the character. There is an appeal to the imagination; you see what
is passing in a poetical point of view. In Crabbe there is no foil, no
contrast, no impulse given to the mind. It is all on a level and of a
piece. In fact, there is so little connection between the subject-matter
of Mr. Crabbe’s lines and the ornament of rhyme which is
tacked to them, that many of his verses read like serious burlesque,
and the parodies which have been made upon them are hardly so
quaint as the originals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Crabbe’s great fault is certainly that he is a sickly, a querulous,
a uniformly dissatisfied poet. He sings the country; and he sings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>it in a pitiful tone. He chooses this subject only to take the charm
out of it, and to dispel the illusion, the glory, and the dream, which
had hovered over it in golden verse from Theocritus to Cowper.
He sets out with professing to overturn the theory which had
hallowed a shepherd’s life, and made the names of grove and valley
music to our ears, in order to give us truth in its stead; but why
not lay aside the fool’s cap and bells at once? Why not insist on
the unwelcome reality in plain prose? If our author is a poet, why
trouble himself with statistics? If he is a statistic writer, why set
his ill news to harsh and grating verse? The philosopher in painting
the dark side of human nature may have reason on his side, and
a moral lesson or remedy in view. The tragic poet, who shows
the sad vicissitudes of things and the disappointments of the passions,
at least strengthens our yearnings after imaginary good, and lends
wings to our desires, by which we, ‘at one bound, high overleap all
bound’ of actual suffering. But Mr. Crabbe does neither. He
gives us discoloured paintings of life; helpless, repining, unprofitable,
unedifying distress. He is not a philosopher, but a sophist, a
misanthrope in verse; a <em>namby-pamby</em> Mandeville, a Malthus turned
metrical romancer. He professes historical fidelity; but his vein
is not dramatic; nor does he give us the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of that
versatile gipsey, Nature. He does not indulge his fancy or
sympathise with us, or tell us how the poor feel; but how he should
feel in their situation, which we do not want to know. He does
not weave the web of their lives of a mingled yarn, good and ill
together, but clothes them all in the same dingy linsey-woolsey, or
tinges them with a green and yellow melancholy. He blocks out
all possibility of good, cancels the hope, or even the wish for it as
a weakness; checkmates Tityrus and Virgil at the game of
pastoral cross-purposes, disables all his adversary’s white pieces, and
leaves none but black ones on the board. The situation of a
country clergyman is not necessarily favourable to the cultivation of
the Muse. He is set down, perhaps, as he thinks, in a small
curacy for life, and he takes his revenge by imprisoning the reader’s
imagination in luckless verse. Shut out from social converse, from
learned colleges and halls, where he passed his youth, he has no
cordial fellow-feeling with the unlettered manners of the <cite>Village</cite> or
the <cite>Borough</cite>; and he describes his neighbours as more uncomfortable
and discontented than himself. All this while he dedicates
successive volumes to rising generations of noble patrons; and
while he desolates a line of coast with sterile, blighting lines, the
only leaf of his books where honour, beauty, worth, or pleasure
bloom, is that inscribed to the Rutland family! We might adduce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>instances of what we have said from every page of his works: let
one suffice—</p>

<p class='c011'>This is an exact <em>fac-simile</em> of some of the most unlovely parts of
the creation. Indeed the whole of Mr. Crabbe’s <cite>Borough</cite>, from
which the above passage is taken, is done so to the life, that it seems
almost like some sea-monster, crawled out of the neighbouring slime,
and harbouring a breed of strange vermin, with a strong local scent
of tar and bulge-water. Mr. Crabbe’s <cite>Tales</cite> are more readable than
his <cite>Poems</cite>; but in proportion as the interest increases, they become
more oppressive. They turn, one and all, upon the same sort of
teazing, helpless, mechanical, unimaginative distress;—and though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>it is not easy to lay them down, you never wish to take them up
again. Still in this way, they are highly finished, striking, and
original portraits, worked out with an eye to nature, and an intimate
knowledge of the small and intricate folds of the human heart.
Some of the best are the <cite>Confidant</cite>, the story of <cite>Silly Shore</cite>, the
<cite>Young Poet</cite>, the <cite>Painter</cite>. The episode of <cite>Phœbe Dawson</cite> in the
<cite>Village</cite>, is one of the most tender and pensive; and the character
of the methodist parson who persecutes the sailor’s widow with his
godly, selfish love is one of the most profound. In a word, if
Mr. Crabbe’s writings do not add greatly to the store of entertaining
and delightful fiction, yet they will remain, ‘as a thorn in the side
of poetry,’ perhaps for a century to come!</p>

<p class='c014'>The lines placed at the head of this sketch, from a contemporary
writer, appear to us very descriptive of Mr. Moore’s poetry. His
verse is like a shower of beauty; a dance of images; a stream of
music; or like the spray of the water-fall, tinged by the morning-beam
with rosy light. The characteristic distinction of our author’s
style is this continuous and incessant flow of voluptuous thoughts and
shining allusions. He ought to write with a crystal pen on silver
paper. His subject is set off by a dazzling veil of poetic diction,
like a wreath of flowers gemmed with innumerous dew-drops, that
weep, tremble, and glitter in liquid softness and pearly light, while
the song of birds ravishes the ear, and languid odours breathe around,
and Aurora opens Heaven’s smiling portals, Peris and nymphs peep
through the golden glades, and an Angel’s wing glances over the
glossy scene.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Mr. Campbell’s imagination is fastidious and select; and hence,
though we meet with more exquisite beauties in his writings, we
meet with them more rarely: there is comparatively a dearth of
ornament. But Mr. Moore’s strictest economy is ‘wasteful and
superfluous excess’: he is always liberal, and never at a loss; for
sooner than not stimulate and delight the reader, he is willing to be
tawdry, or superficial, or common-place. His Muse must be fine
at any rate, though she should paint, and wear cast-off decorations.
Rather than have any lack of excitement, he repeats himself; and
‘Eden, and Eblis, and cherub-smiles’ fill up the pauses of the
sentiment with a sickly monotony.—It has been too much our
author’s object to pander to the artificial taste of the age; and his
productions, however brilliant and agreeable, are in consequence somewhat
meretricious and effeminate. It was thought formerly enough to
have an occasionally fine passage in the progress of a story or a poem,
and an occasionally striking image or expression in a fine passage or
description. But this style, it seems, was to be exploded as rude,
Gothic, meagre, and dry. Now all must be raised to the same
tantalising and preposterous level. There must be no pause, no
interval, no repose, no gradation. Simplicity and truth yield up
the palm to affectation and grimace. The craving of the public
mind after novelty and effect is a false and uneasy appetite that must
be pampered with fine words at every step—we must be tickled
with sound, startled with show, and relieved by the importunate,
uninterrupted display of fancy and verbal tinsel as much as possible
from the fatigue of thought or shock of feeling. A poem is to
resemble an exhibition of fire-works, with a continual explosion of
quaint figures and devices, flash after flash, that surprise for the
moment, and leave no trace of light or warmth behind them. Or
modern poetry in its retrograde progress comes at last to be constructed
on the principles of the modern <span class='sc'>Opera</span>, where an attempt
is made to gratify every sense at every instant, and where the
understanding alone is insulted and the heart mocked. It is in this
view only that we can discover that Mr. Moore’s poetry is vitiated
or immoral,—it seduces the taste and enervates the imagination. It
creates a false standard of reference, and inverts or decompounds the
natural order of association, in which objects strike the thoughts and
feelings. His is the poetry of the bath, of the toilette, of the saloon,
of the fashionable world; not the poetry of nature, of the heart, or
of human life. He stunts and enfeebles equally the growth of the
imagination and the affections, by not taking the seed of poetry and
sowing it in the ground of truth, and letting it expand in the dew
and rain, and shoot up to heaven,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>‘And spread its sweet leaves to the air,</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>instead of which he anticipates and defeats his own object, by
plucking flowers and blossoms from the stem, and setting them in
the ground of idleness and folly—or in the cap of his own vanity,
where they soon wither and disappear, ‘dying or ere they sicken!’
This is but a sort of child’s play, a short-sighted ambition. In
Milton we meet with many prosaic lines, either because the subject
does not require raising or because they are necessary to connect the
story, or serve as a relief to other passages—there is not such a
thing to be found in all Mr. Moore’s writings. His volumes present
us with ‘a perpetual feast of nectar’d sweets’—but we cannot add—‘where
no crude surfeit reigns.’ He indeed cloys with sweetness;
he obscures with splendour; he fatigues with gaiety. We are
stifled on beds of roses—we literally lie ‘on the rack of restless
ecstacy.’ His flowery fancy ‘looks so fair and smells so sweet,
that the sense aches at it.’ His verse droops and languishes under a
load of beauty, like a bough laden with fruit. His gorgeous style is
like ‘another morn risen on mid-noon.’ There is no passage that
is not made up of blushing lines, no line that is not enriched with a
sparkling metaphor, no image that is left unadorned with a double
epithet—all his verbs, nouns, adjectives, are equally glossy, smooth,
and beautiful. Every stanza is transparent with light, perfumed with
odours, floating in liquid harmony, melting in luxurious, evanescent
delights. His Muse is never contented with an offering from one
sense alone, but brings another rifled charm to match it, and revels in
a fairy round of pleasure. The interest is not dramatic, but melodramatic—it
is a mixture of painting, poetry, and music, of the
natural and preternatural, of obvious sentiment and romantic costume.
A rose is a <em>Gul</em>, a nightingale a <em>Bulbul</em>. We might fancy ourselves
in an eastern harem, amidst Ottomans, and otto of roses, and veils
and spangles, and marble pillars, and cool fountains, and Arab maids
and Genii, and magicians, and Peris, and cherubs, and what not?
Mr. Moore has a little mistaken the art of poetry for the <em>cosmetic art</em>.
He does not compose an historic group, or work out a single figure;
but throws a variety of elementary sensations, of vivid impressions
together, and calls it a description. He makes out an inventory of
beauty—the smile on the lips, the dimple on the cheeks, <em>item</em>, golden
locks, <em>item</em>, a pair of blue wings, <em>item</em>, a silver sound, with breathing
fragrance and radiant light, and thinks it a character or a story. He
gets together a number of fine things and fine names, and thinks that,
flung on heaps, they make up a fine poem. This dissipated, fulsome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>painted, patchwork style may succeed in the levity and languor of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boudoir</span></i>, or might have been adapted to the Pavilions of royalty,
but it is not the style of Parnassus, nor a passport to Immortality.
It is not the taste of the ancients, ‘’tis not classical lore’—nor the
fashion of Tibullus, or Theocritus, or Anacreon, or Virgil, or Ariosto,
or Pope, or Byron, or any great writer among the living or the dead,
but it is the style of our English Anacreon, and it is (or was) the
fashion of the day! Let one example (and that an admired one),
taken from <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>, suffice to explain the mystery and soften the
harshness of the foregoing criticism.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Moore ought not to contend with serious difficulties or with
entire subjects. He can write verses, not a poem. There is no
principle of massing or of continuity in his productions—neither
height nor breadth nor depth of capacity. There is no truth of
representation, no strong internal feeling—but a continual flutter and
display of affected airs and graces, like a finished coquette, who hides
the want of symmetry by extravagance of dress, and the want of
passion by flippant forwardness and unmeaning sentimentality. All
is flimsy, all is florid to excess. His imagination may dally with
insect beauties, with Rosicrucian spells; may describe a butterfly’s
wing, a flower-pot, a fan: but it should not attempt to span the great
outlines of nature, or keep pace with the sounding march of events,
or grapple with the strong fibres of the human heart. The great
becomes turgid in his hands, the pathetic insipid. If Mr. Moore were
to describe the heights of Chimboraco, instead of the loneliness, the
vastness and the shadowy might, he would only think of adorning it
with roseate tints, like a strawberry-ice, and would transform a
magician’s fortress in the Himmalaya (stripped of its mysterious
gloom and frowning horrors) into a jeweller’s toy, to be set upon a
lady’s toilette. In proof of this, see above ‘the diamond turrets of
Shadukiam,’ &amp;c. The description of Mokanna in the fight, though
it has spirit and grandeur of effect, has still a great alloy of the mock-heroic
in it. The route of blood and death, which is otherwise well
marked, is infested with a swarm of ‘fire-fly’ fancies.</p>

only these vapid, varnished sentiments, lip-deep, and let its tears of

<p class='c015'>Nothing in Pope or Prior ever surpassed the delicate insinuation and
adroit satire of these lines, and hundreds more of our author’s composition.
We wish he would not take pains to make us think of
them with less pleasure than formerly.—The ‘Fudge Family’ is in
the same spirit, but with a little falling-off. There is too great
a mixture of undisguised Jacobinism and fashionable <em>slang</em>. The
‘divine Fanny Bias’ and ‘the mountains <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Russe</span></i>’ figure in somewhat
quaintly with Buonaparte and the Bourbons. The poet also
launches the lightning of political indignation; but it rather plays
round and illumines his own pen than reaches the devoted heads
at which it is aimed!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Moore is in private life an amiable and estimable man. The
embellished and voluptuous style of his poetry, his unpretending origin,
and his <em>mignon</em> figure, soon introduced him to the notice of the great,
and his gaiety, his wit, his good-humour, and many agreeable accomplishments
fixed him there, the darling of his friends and the idol of
fashion. If he is no longer familiar with Royalty as with his garter,
the fault is not his—his adherence to his principles caused the separation—his
love of his country was the cloud that intercepted the
sunshine of court-favour. This is so far well. Mr. Moore vindicates
his own dignity; but the sense of intrinsic worth, of wide-spread
fame, and of the intimacy of the great makes him perhaps a little too
fastidious and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exigeant</span></i> as to the pretensions of others. He has been
so long accustomed to the society of Whig Lords, and so enchanted
with the smile of beauty and fashion, that he really fancies himself
one of the <em>set</em>, to which he is admitted on sufferance, and tries very
unnecessarily to keep others out of it. He talks familiarly of works
that are or are not read ‘in <em>our</em> circle’; and seated smiling and at his
ease in a coronet-coach, enlivening the owner by his brisk sallies and
Attic conceits, is shocked, as he passes, to see a Peer of the realm
shake hands with a poet. There is a little indulgence of spleen and
envy, a little servility and pandering to aristocratic pride in this proceeding.
Is Mr. Moore bound to advise a Noble Poet to get as fast
as possible out of a certain publication, lest he should not be able to
give an account at Holland or at Lansdown House, how his friend
Lord B—— had associated himself with his friend L. H——? Is
he afraid that the ‘Spirit of Monarchy’ will eclipse the ‘Fables for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>the Holy Alliance’ in virulence and plain speaking? Or are the
members of the ‘Fudge Family’ to secure a monopoly for the abuse
of the Bourbons and the doctrine of Divine Right? Because he is
genteel and sarcastic, may not others be paradoxical and argumentative?
Or must no one bark at a Minister or General, unless they
have been first dandled, like a little French pug-dog, in the lap of a
lady of quality? Does Mr. Moore insist on the double claim of
birth and genius as a title to respectability in all advocates of the
popular side—but himself? Or is he anxious to keep the pretensions
of his patrician and plebeian friends quite separate, so as to be himself
the only point of union, a sort of <em>double meaning</em>, between the two?
It is idle to think of setting bounds to the weakness and illusions of
self-love as long as it is confined to a man’s own breast; but it ought
not to be made a plea for holding back the powerful hand that is
stretched out to save another struggling with the tide of popular
prejudice, who has suffered shipwreck of health, fame, and fortune
in a common cause, and who has deserved the aid and the good
wishes of all who are (on principle) embarked in the same cause by
equal zeal and honesty, if not by equal talents to support and to
adorn it!</p>

<p class='c011'>We shall conclude the present article with a short notice of an
individual who, in the cast of his mind and in political principle,
bears no very remote resemblance to the patriot and wit just spoken
of, and on whose merits we should descant at greater length, but that
personal intimacy might be supposed to render us partial. It is well
when personal intimacy produces this effect; and when the light, that
dazzled us at a distance, does not on a closer inspection turn out an
opaque substance. This is a charge that none of his friends will
bring against Mr. Leigh Hunt. He improves upon acquaintance.
The author translates admirably into the man. Indeed the very
faults of his style are virtues in the individual. His natural gaiety
and sprightliness of manner, his high animal spirits, and the <em>vinous</em>
quality of his mind, produce an immediate fascination and intoxication
in those who come in contact with him, and carry off in society whatever
in his writings may to some seem flat and impertinent. From
great sanguineness of temper, from great quickness and unsuspecting
simplicity, he runs on to the public as he does at his own fireside,
and talks about himself, forgetting that he is not always among
friends. His look, his tone are required to point many things that
he says: his frank, cordial manner reconciles you instantly to a little
over-bearing, over-weening self-complacency. ‘To be admired, he
needs but to be seen’: but perhaps he ought to be seen to be fully
appreciated. No one ever sought his society who did not come away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>with a more favourable opinion of him: no one was ever disappointed,
except those who had entertained idle prejudices against him. He
sometimes trifles with his readers, or tires of a subject (from not
being urged on by the stimulus of immediate sympathy)—but in conversation
he is all life and animation, combining the vivacity of the
school-boy with the resources of the wit and the taste of the scholar.
The personal character, the spontaneous impulses, do not appear to
excuse the author, unless you are acquainted with his situation and
habits—like some proud beauty who gives herself what we think
strange airs and graces under a mask, but who is instantly forgiven
when she shews her face. We have said that Lord Byron is a
sublime coxcomb: why should we not say that Mr. Hunt is a
delightful one? There is certainly an exuberance of satisfaction in
his manner which is more than the strict logical premises warrant,
and which dull and phlegmatic constitutions know nothing of, and
cannot understand till they see it. He is the only poet or literary
man we ever knew who puts us in mind of Sir John Suckling or
Killigrew or Carew; or who united rare intellectual acquirements
with outward grace and natural gentility. Mr. Hunt ought to have
been a gentleman born, and to have patronised men of letters. He
might then have played, and sung, and laughed, and talked his life
away; have written manly prose, elegant verse; and his <cite>Story of
Rimini</cite> would have been praised by Mr. Blackwood. As it is, there
is no man now living who at the same time writes prose and verse so
well, with the exception of Mr. Southey (an exception, we fear, that
will be little palatable to either of these gentlemen). His prose
writings, however, display more consistency of principle than the
laureate’s; his verses more taste. We will venture to oppose his
Third Canto of the <cite>Story of Rimini</cite> for classic elegance and natural
feeling to any equal number of lines from Mr. Southey’s Epics or
from Mr. Moore’s Lalla Rookh. In a more gay and conversational
style of writing, we think his <cite>Epistle to Lord Byron</cite> on his going
abroad, is a masterpiece;—and the <cite>Feast of the Poets</cite> has run through
several editions. A light, familiar grace, and mild unpretending
pathos are the characteristics of his more sportive or serious writings,
whether in poetry or prose. A smile plays round the sparkling
features of the one; a tear is ready to start from the thoughtful gaze
of the other. He perhaps takes too little pains, and indulges in too
much wayward caprice in both. A wit and a poet, Mr. Hunt is also
distinguished by fineness of tact and sterling sense: he has only been
a visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue. What then is the drawback
to so many shining qualities, that has made them useless, or
even hurtful to their owner? His crime is, to have been Editor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>the <cite>Examiner</cite> ten years ago, when some allusion was made in it to
the age of the present King, and though his Majesty has grown
older, our luckless politician is no wiser than he was then!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ELIA, AND GEOFFREY CRAYON</h3>

<p class='c008'>So Mr. Charles Lamb and Mr. Washington Irvine choose to designate
themselves; and as their lucubrations under one or other of these
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noms de guerre</span></i> have gained considerable notice from the public, we
shall here attempt to discriminate their several styles and manner,
and to point out the beauties and defects of each in treating of
somewhat similar subjects.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Irvine is, we take it, the more popular writer of the two, or a
more general favourite: Mr. Lamb has more devoted, and perhaps
more judicious partisans. Mr. Irvine is by birth an American, and
has, as it were, <em>skimmed the cream</em>, and taken off patterns with great
skill and cleverness, from our best known and happiest writers, so that
their thoughts and almost their reputation are indirectly transferred
to his page, and smile upon us from another hemisphere, like ‘the
pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow’: he succeeds to our admiration and
our sympathy by a sort of prescriptive title and traditional privilege.
Mr. Lamb, on the contrary, being ‘native to the manner here,’
though he too has borrowed from previous sources, instead of availing
himself of the most popular and admired, has groped out his way,
and made his most successful researches among the more obscure and
intricate, though certainly not the least pithy or pleasant of our
writers. Mr. Washington Irvine has culled and transplanted the
flowers of modern literature, for the amusement of the general reader:
Mr. Lamb has raked among the dust and cobwebs of a more remote
period, has exhibited specimens of curious relics, and pored over
moth-eaten, decayed manuscripts, for the benefit of the more inquisitive
and discerning part of the public. Antiquity after time has the
grace of novelty, as old fashions revived are mistaken for new ones;
and a certain quaintness and singularity of style is an agreeable relief
to the smooth and insipid monotony of modern composition. Mr.
Lamb has succeeded not by conforming to the <cite>Spirit of the Age</cite>, but
in opposition to it. He does not march boldly along with the crowd,
but steals off the pavement to pick his way in the contrary direction.
He prefers <em>bye-ways</em> to <em>highways</em>. When the full tide of human life
pours along to some festive show, to some pageant of a day, Elia
would stand on one side to look over an old book-stall, or stroll down
some deserted pathway in search of a pensive inscription over a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>tottering doorway, or some quaint device in architecture, illustrative
of embryo art and ancient manners. Mr. Lamb has the very soul
of an antiquarian, as this implies a reflecting humanity; the film of
the past hovers forever before him. He is shy, sensitive, the reverse
of every thing coarse, vulgar, obtrusive, and <em>common-place</em>. He would
fain ‘shuffle off this mortal coil,’ and his spirit clothes itself in the
garb of elder time, homelier, but more durable. He is borne along
with no pompous paradoxes, shines in no glittering tinsel of a fashionable
phraseology; is neither fop nor sophist. He has none of the
turbulence or froth of new-fangled opinions. His style runs pure
and clear, though it may often take an underground course, or be conveyed
through old-fashioned conduit-pipes. Mr. Lamb does not
court popularity, nor strut in gaudy plumes, but shrinks from every
kind of ostentatious and obvious pretension into the retirement of his
own mind.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>These lines well describe the modest and delicate beauties of
Mr. Lamb’s writings, contrasted with the lofty and vain-glorious
pretensions of some of his contemporaries. This gentleman is not
one of those who pay all their homage to the prevailing idol: he
thinks that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘New-born gauds are made and moulded of things past,’</div>

      <div class='line'>More laud than gilt o’er-dusted.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>His convictions ‘do not in broad rumour lie,’ nor are they ‘set off
to the world in the glistering foil’ of fashion; but ‘live and breathe
aloft in those pure eyes, and perfect judgment of all-seeing <em>time</em>.’
Mr. Lamb rather affects and is tenacious of the obscure and remote:
of that which rests on its own intrinsic and silent merit; which
scorns all alliance, or even the suspicion of owing any thing to noisy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>clamour, to the glare of circumstances. There is a fine tone of
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i>, a moral perspective in his writings. He delights to
dwell on that which is fresh to the eye of memory; he yearns after
and covets what soothes the frailty of human nature. That touches
him most nearly which is withdrawn to a certain distance, which
verges on the borders of oblivion:—that piques and provokes his
fancy most, which is hid from a superficial glance. That which,
though gone by, is still remembered, is in his view more genuine,
and has given more ‘vital signs that it will live,’ than a thing of
yesterday, that may be forgotten to-morrow. Death has in this
sense the spirit of life in it; and the shadowy has to our author
something substantial in it. Ideas savour most of reality in his mind;
or rather his imagination loiters on the edge of each, and a page of
his writings recals to our fancy the <em>stranger</em> on the grate, fluttering in
its dusky tenuity, with its idle superstition and hospitable welcome!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lamb has a distaste to new faces, to new books, to new
buildings, to new customs. He is shy of all imposing appearances,
of all assumptions of self-importance, of all adventitious ornaments, of
all mechanical advantages, even to a nervous excess. It is not
merely that he does not rely upon, or ordinarily avail himself of
them; he holds them in abhorrence, he utterly abjures and discards
them, and places a great gulph between him and them. He disdains
all the vulgar artifices of authorship, all the cant of criticism, and
helps to notoriety. He has no grand swelling theories to attract the
visionary and the enthusiast, no passing topics to allure the thoughtless
and the vain. He evades the present, he mocks the future. His
affections revert to, and settle on the past, but then, even this must
have something personal and local in it to interest him deeply and
thoroughly; he pitches his tent in the suburbs of existing manners;
brings down the account of character to the few straggling remains of
the last generation; seldom ventures beyond the bills of mortality,
and occupies that nice point between egotism and disinterested
humanity. No one makes the tour of our southern metropolis, or
describes the manners of the last age, so well as Mr. Lamb—with so
fine, and yet so formal an air—with such vivid obscurity, with such
arch piquancy, such picturesque quaintness, such smiling pathos.
How admirably he has sketched the former inmates of the South-Sea
House; what ‘fine fretwork he makes of their double and single
entries!’ With what a firm, yet subtle pencil he has embodied
<cite>Mrs. Battle’s Opinions on Whist</cite>! How notably he embalms a
battered <em>beau</em>; how delightfully an amour, that was cold forty years
ago, revives in his pages! With what well-disguised humour, he
introduces us to his relations, and how freely he serves up his friends!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Certainly, some of his portraits are <em>fixtures</em>, and will do to hang up as
lasting and lively emblems of human infirmity. Then there is no one
who has so sure an ear for ‘the chimes at midnight,’ not even
excepting Mr. Justice Shallow; nor could Master Silence himself
take his ‘cheese and pippins’ with a more significant and satisfactory
air. With what a gusto Mr. Lamb describes the inns and courts of
law, the Temple and Gray’s-Inn, as if he had been a student there
for the last two hundred years, and had been as well acquainted with
the person of Sir Francis Bacon as he is with his portrait or writings!
It is hard to say whether St. John’s Gate is connected with more
intense and authentic associations in his mind, as a part of old London
Wall, or as the frontispiece (time out of mind) of the Gentleman’s
Magazine. He haunts Watling-street like a gentle spirit; the
avenues to the play-houses are thick with panting recollections, and
Christ’s-Hospital still breathes the balmy breath of infancy in his
description of it! Whittington and his Cat are a fine hallucination
for Mr. Lamb’s historic Muse, and we believe he never heartily
forgave a certain writer who took the subject of Guy Faux out of
his hands. The streets of London are his fairy-land, teeming with
wonder, with life and interest to his retrospective glance, as it did to
the eager eye of childhood; he has contrived to weave its tritest
traditions into a bright and endless romance!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lamb’s taste in books is also fine, and it is peculiar. It is
not the worse for a little <em>idiosyncrasy</em>. He does not go deep into the
Scotch novels, but he is at home in Smollet or Fielding. He is
little read in Junius or Gibbon, but no man can give a better account
of Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy, or Sir Thomas Brown’s Urn-Burial,
or Fuller’s Worthies, or John Bunyan’s Holy War. No
one is more unimpressible to a specious declamation; no one relishes
a recondite beauty more. His admiration of Shakespear and Milton
does not make him despise Pope; and he can read Parnell with
patience, and Gay with delight. His taste in French and German
literature is somewhat defective; nor has he made much progress in
the science of Political Economy or other abstruse studies, though he
has read vast folios of controversial divinity, merely for the sake of
the intricacy of style, and to save himself the pain of thinking.
Mr. Lamb is a good judge of prints and pictures. His admiration
of Hogarth does credit to both, particularly when it is considered
that Leonardo da Vinci is his next greatest favourite, and that his
love of the <em>actual</em> does not proceed from a want of taste for the <em>ideal</em>.
His worst fault is an over-eagerness of enthusiasm, which occasionally
makes him take a surfeit of his highest favourites.—Mr. Lamb excels
in familiar conversation almost as much as in writing, when his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>modesty does not overpower his self-possession. He is as little of
a proser as possible; but he <em>blurts</em> out the finest wit and sense in the
world. He keeps a good deal in the back-ground at first, till some
excellent conceit pushes him forward, and then he abounds in whim
and pleasantry. There is a primitive simplicity and self-denial about
his manners; and a Quakerism in his personal appearance, which is,
however, relieved by a fine Titian head, full of dumb eloquence!
Mr. Lamb is a general favourite with those who know him. His
character is equally singular and amiable. He is endeared to his
friends not less by his foibles than his virtues; he insures their esteem
by the one, and does not wound their self-love by the other. He
gains ground in the opinion of others, by making no advances in his
own. We easily admire genius where the diffidence of the possessor
makes our acknowledgment of merit seem like a sort of patronage, or
act of condescension, as we willingly extend our good offices where
they are not exacted as obligations, or repaid with sullen indifference.—The style of the Essays of Elia is liable to the charge of a certain
<em>mannerism</em>. His sentences are cast in the mould of old authors; his
expressions are borrowed from them; but his feelings and observations
are genuine and original, taken from actual life, or from his own
breast; and he may be said (if any one can) ‘to have coined his
heart for <em>jests</em>,’ and to have split his brain for fine distinctions!
Mr. Lamb, from the peculiarity of his exterior and address as an
author, would probably never have made his way by detached and
independent efforts; but, fortunately for himself and others, he has
taken advantage of the Periodical Press, where he has been stuck
into notice, and the texture of his compositions is assuredly fine
enough to bear the broadest glare of popularity that has hitherto
shone upon them. Mr. Lamb’s literary efforts have procured him
civic honours (a thing unheard of in our times), and he has been
invited, in his character of <span class='sc'>Elia</span>, to dine at a select party with the
Lord Mayor. We should prefer this distinction to that of being
poet-laureat. We would recommend to Mr. Waithman’s perusal
(if Mr. Lamb has not anticipated us) the <cite>Rosamond Gray</cite> and the
<cite>John Woodvil</cite> of the same author, as an agreeable relief to the noise
of a City feast, and the heat of City elections. A friend, a short
time ago, quoted some lines<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a> from the last-mentioned of these works,
which meeting Mr. Godwin’s eye, he was so struck with the beauty
of the passage, and with a consciousness of having seen it before, that he
was uneasy till he could recollect where, and after hunting in vain for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>it in Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and other not unlikely places,
sent to Mr. Lamb to know if he could help him to the author!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washington Irvine’s acquaintance with English literature
begins almost where Mr. Lamb’s ends,—with the Spectator, Tom
Brown’s works and the wits of Queen Anne. He is not bottomed
in our elder writers, nor do we think that he has tasked his own
faculties much, at least on English ground. Of the merit of his
<cite>Knicker-bocker</cite>, and New York stories, we cannot pretend to judge.
But in his <cite>Sketch-book</cite> and <cite>Bracebridge-Hall</cite> he gives us very good
American copies of our British Essayists and Novelists, which may
be very well on the other side of the water, or as proofs of the
capabilities of the national genius, but which might be dispensed with
here, where we have to boast of the originals. Not only Mr.
Irvine’s language is with great taste and felicity modelled on that of
Addison, Goldsmith, Sterne, or Mackenzie; but the thoughts and
sentiments are taken at the rebound, and as they are brought forward
at the present period, want both freshness and probability. Mr.
Irvine’s writings are literary <em>anachronisms</em>. He comes to England
for the first time; and being on the spot, fancies himself in the
midst of those characters and manners which he had read of in the
Spectator and other approved authors, and which were the only
idea he had hitherto formed of the parent country. Instead of
looking round to see what <em>we are</em>, he sets to work to describe us as
<em>we were</em>—at second hand. He has Parson Adams, or Sir Roger de
Coverley in his ‘<em>mind’s eye</em>‘; and he makes a village curate or a
country ‘squire in Yorkshire or Hampshire sit to these admired
models for their portraits in the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Whatever the ingenious author has been most delighted with in the
representations of books, he transfers to his port-folio, and swears
that he has found it actually existing in the course of his observation
and travels through Great Britain. Instead of tracing the changes
that have taken place in society since Addison or Fielding wrote, he
transcribes their account in a different hand-writing, and thus keeps
us stationary, at least in our most attractive and praise-worthy qualities
of simplicity, honesty, modesty, hospitality, and good-nature. This is
a very flattering mode of turning fiction into history, or history into
fiction; and we should scarcely know ourselves again in the softened
and altered likeness, but that it bears the date of 1820, and issues
from the press in Albemarle-street. This is one way of complimenting
our national and Tory prejudices; and coupled with literal or
exaggerated portraits of <em>Yankee</em> peculiarities, could hardly fail to
please. The first Essay in the <cite>Sketch-book</cite>, that on national Antipathies,
is the best; but after that, the sterling ore of wit or feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>is gradually spun thinner and thinner, till it fades to the shadow
of a shade. Mr. Irvine is himself, we believe, a most agreeable and
deserving man, and has been led into the natural and pardonable
error we speak of, by the tempting bait of European popularity, in
which he thought there was no more likely method of succeeding
than by imitating the style of our standard authors, and giving us
credit for the virtues of our forefathers.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c011'>We should not feel that we had discharged our obligations to
truth or friendship, if we were to let this volume go without introducing
into it the name of the author of <cite>Virginius</cite>. This is the
more proper, inasmuch as he is a character by himself, and the only
poet now living that is a mere poet. If we were asked what sort of
man Mr. Knowles is, we could only say, ‘he is the writer of
Virginius.’ His most intimate friends see nothing in him, by which
they could trace the work to the author. The seeds of dramatic
genius are contained and fostered in the warmth of the blood that
flows in his veins; his heart dictates to his head. The most unconscious,
the most unpretending, the most artless of mortals, he
instinctively obeys the impulses of natural feeling, and produces a
perfect work of art. He has hardly read a poem or a play or seen
any thing of the world, but he hears the anxious beatings of his own
heart, and makes others feel them by the force of sympathy. Ignorant
alike of rules, regardless of models, he follows the steps of truth
and simplicity; and strength, proportion, and delicacy are the infallible
results. By thinking of nothing but his subject, he rivets the attention
of the audience to it. All his dialogue tends to action, all his
situations form classic groups. There is no doubt that Virginius is
the best acting tragedy that has been produced on the modern stage.
Mr. Knowles himself was a player at one time, and this circumstance
has probably enabled him to judge of the picturesque and dramatic
effect of his lines, as we think it might have assisted Shakespear.
There is no impertinent display, no flaunting poetry; the writer
immediately conceives how a thought would tell if he had to speak it
himself. Mr. Knowles is the first tragic writer of the age; in other
respects he is a common man; and divides his time and his affections
between his plots and his fishing-tackle, between the Muses’ spring,
and those mountain-streams which sparkle like his own eye, that gush
out like his own voice at the sight of an old friend. We have known
him almost from a child, and we must say he appears to us the same
boy-poet that he ever was. He has been cradled in song, and rocked
in it as in a dream, forgetful of himself and of the world!</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Published in 1807 in an 8vo volume (xlvii + 529 pp.) with the following
title-page:—‘An Abridgment of the Light of Nature Pursued, by Abraham
Tucker, Esq. originally published, in seven volumes, under the name of Edward
Search, Esq. London: Printed for J. Johnson, St. Paul’s Churchyard; By
T. Bensley, Bolt Court. 1807.’</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>PREFACE TO AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE LIGHT OF NATURE PURSUED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are two considerations which seem necessary to be attended
to in abridging any author; the size of the work, rendering it
inaccessible to the generality of readers, and the merit of the work,
rendering it desirable that it should be within every one’s reach. It
is easy to perceive, that these two conditions are not always united:
there are some works whose only merit seems to be, that they are so
large that nobody can read them; whose ponderous bulk, and formidable
appearance, happily serve as a barrier to keep out the infection
of their dulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work, of which the following is an abridgment, notwithstanding
its excellence, has been little read. A philosophical work in seven
large volumes presents no very great attractions to the indolent
curiosity of most readers. Even the seven volumes of Clarissa, and
Sir Charles Grandison, are at present viewed with doubtful looks by
the eye of taste, and reluctantly engaged in: and our modern novelists,
that happily privileged race of authors, whose works ‘not sicklied o’er
with the pale cast of thought,’ are exempt from the charge of dulness
or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, have been obliged to contract the boundless scenes of their
imagination within four slender volumes, where the diminutive page vies
in vain with the luxuriant margin. As to the studious and recluse
reader, there is generally another obstacle which prevents him from
gratifying his curiosity with respect to works of this extent, however
valuable or important.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, there are works of great length, which cannot, however,
be reduced into a less compass, ‘without suffering loss and diminution.’
Though vast, there is nothing useless, nothing superfluous in them;
and nothing can be taken away or displaced, without destroying the
symmetry and connection of the whole. This is certainly not the
case with the writings of Abraham Tucker: they are encumbered
and weighed down with a load of unnecessary matter. Not that
there are any great inequalities in them, nor any parts which, taken
separately, are not entertaining and valuable; but the work is swelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>out with endless repetitions of itself. The same thing is said over
and over again; the same subjects discussed in a different shape, till
the reader is tired, and his attention quite distracted. This radical
defect, which is certainly a drawback on the usefulness of the work,
appears evidently to have arisen from the manner of composing it.
The author was a private gentleman, who wrote at his ease, and for
his own amusement: he had nothing to do but to take his time, and
follow the whim of the moment. He wrote without any regular
plan, and without foreseeing or being concerned about the deviations,
the shiftings and windings, and the intricate cross-movements in which
he should be entangled. He had leisure on his hands; and provided he
got out of the labyrinth at last, he was satisfied—no matter how often
he had lost his way in it. When a subject presented itself to him, he
exhausted all he had to say upon it, and then dismissed it for another.
The chapter was thrown aside, and forgotten. If the same subject
recurred again in a different connection, he turned it over in his
thoughts afresh; as his ideas arose in his mind, he committed them
to paper; he repeated the same things over again, or inserted any new
observation or example that suggested itself to him in confirmation of
his argument; and thus by the help of a new title, and by giving a
different application to the whole, a new chapter was completed. By
this means, as he himself remarks, his writings are rather a tissue of
loose essays than a regular work; and indeed the leaves of the Sybils
could not be more loose and unconnected. It is so far then from
being an injury, that it must be rather an advantage to the original
work to expunge its repetitions, and confine its digressions, if this
could be done properly.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is, in fact, what I have attempted to do: whenever I came
to a passage that was merely a repetition of a former one, I struck it
out: and at the same time, I endeavoured to abridge those detailed
parts of the work which were the longest, and the least interesting,
and to correct the general redundance of the style. I have not,
however (that I know of), omitted any thing essential to the merit of
the work. All the singular observations, all the fine illustrations,
I have given nearly in an entire state to the reader: I was afraid to
touch them, lest I should spoil them. The rule that I went by was,
to give every thing that I thought would strike the attention in
reading the work itself, and to leave out every thing (except what was
absolutely necessary to the understanding of the subject), that would
be likely to make no lasting impression on the mind. A good
abridgment ought to contain just as much as we should wish to
recollect of a book; it should give back (only in a more perfect
manner) to a reader well acquainted with the original, ‘the image of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>his mind,’ so that he would miss no favourite passage, none of the
prominent parts, or distinguishing features of the work. How far
I have succeeded, must be left to the decision of others: and
perhaps in some respects one is less a judge of the execution of a
work like this, than of an original performance. The same deception
takes place here, as, I have been told by painters, sometimes happens
in copying a fine picture. Your mind is full of the original, and you
see the imitation through this borrowed medium; you transfuse its
grace and spirit into the copy; you connect its glowing tints and
delicate touches with a meagre outline, and a warm fancy sheds its
lustre over that which is little better than a blank: but when the
original impression is faded, and you have nothing left but the copy
for the imagination to feed on, you find the spirit evaporated, the
expression gone, and you wonder at your own mistake. I can only
say, that I have done my best to prevent my copy of the Light of
Nature from degenerating into a mere <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i>. As to the pains
and labour it has cost me, or the time I have devoted to it, I shall
say nothing. However, if any one should be scrupulous on that
head, I might answer, as Sir Joshua Reynolds is said to have done to
some person who cavilled at the price of a picture, and desired to
know how long he had been doing it, ‘All my life.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the work itself, I can speak with more confidence. I do not
know of any work in the shape of a philosophical treatise that
contains so much good sense so agreeably expressed. The character
of the work is, in this respect, altogether singular. Amidst all the
abstruseness of the most subtle disquisitions, it is as familiar as
Montaigne, and as wild and entertaining as John Buncle. To the
ingenuity and closeness of the metaphysician, he unites the principal
knowledge of the man of the world, and the utmost sprightliness, and
even levity of imagination. He is the only philosopher who appears
to have had his senses always <em>about him</em>, or to have possessed the
enviable faculty of attending at the same time to what was passing in
his own mind, and what was going on without him. He applied
every thing to the purposes of philosophy; he could not see any thing,
the most familiar objects or the commonest events, without connecting
them with the illustration of some difficult problem. The tricks of a
young kitten, or a little child at play, were sure to suggest to him
some useful observation, or nice distinction. To this habit, he was,
no doubt, indebted for what Paley justly calls ‘his unrivalled power
of illustration.’ To be convinced that he possessed this power in the
highest degree, it is only necessary to look into almost any page of
his writings: at least, I think it impossible for any one not to perceive
the beauty, the <em>naiveté</em>, the force, the clearness, and propriety of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>illustrations, who has not previously had his understanding strangely
overlaid with logic and criticism.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a>—If he was surpassed by one or two
writers in logical precision and systematic profundity, there is no metaphysical
writer who is equal to him in clearness of apprehension, and a
various insight into human nature. Though he excelled greatly in
both, yet, he excelled more in what is called the method of induction,
than that of analysis: he convinces the reader oftener by shewing him
the thing in dispute, than by defining its abstract qualities; as the
philosopher is said to have proved the existence of motion by getting up
and walking. I do not, for my own part, look up with all that awe
and admiration to the grave professors of abstract reasoning that it is
usual to do. They are so far from being men of great comprehension
of mind, (if by this we are to understand comprehending the whole
of every subject) that the contrary is generally the case. They are
persons of few ideas, of slow perceptions, of narrow capacities, of dull
but retentive feelings, who cannot seize or enter into the infinite
variety and rapid succession of natural objects, and are only susceptible
of those impressions of things, which being common to all objects, and
constantly repeated, come at length to fix those lasting traces in the
mind, which nothing can ever alter or wear out. By attending only
to one aspect of things, and that the same, and by leaving out always
those minute differences and perplexing irregularities which disturb
the sluggish uniformity of our ideas, and give life and motion to our
being, men of formal understandings are sometimes able to pursue
their inquiries with a steadiness and certainty that are incompatible
with a more extensive range of thought. Abstraction is a trick to
supply the defect of comprehension. The moulds of the understanding
may be said not to be large enough to contain the gross concrete
objects of nature, but will still admit of their names, and descriptions,
and general forms, which lie flatter and closer in the brain, and are
more easily managed. The most perfect abstraction is nothing more
than the art of making use of only one half of the understanding, and
never seeing more than one half of a subject, in the same manner as
we find that those persons have the acutest perceptions, who have lost
some one of their senses. A man, therefore, who disdains the use of
common sense, and thinks to arrive at the highest point of philosophy,
by thus denaturalizing his understanding, is like a person who should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>deprive himself of the use of his eye-sight, in order that he might be
able to grope his way better in the dark!</p>

<p class='c011'>A man may set up for a system-maker, upon a single idea: he
cannot write a sensible book without a great many. I do not deny
that one idea may often involve, and be the parent of many others:
but I do not see how knowledge is at all the worse, because it brings
us immediately acquainted with the very form of truth, instead of
serving merely as an index, or clue to direct us in the search of it.
If the one method tends more effectually to sharpen the understanding,
the other enriches it more. The one method puts you upon exerting
your own faculties; the other, meeting you half way, wisely saves you
from the necessity of taking all that pains and trouble in the search
after truth, which few persons are disposed to take, and is therefore
more generally useful. The great merit of our author’s writings is
undoubtedly that sound, practical, comprehensive good sense, which is
to be found in every part of them. What is I believe the truest
test of fine sense, is that affecting simplicity in his observations, which
proceeds from their extreme truth and liveliness. Whatever recalls
strongly to our remembrance the common feelings of human nature,
and marks distinctly the changes that take place in the human breast,
must always be accompanied with some sense of emotion; for our
own nature can never be indifferent to us.</p>

<p class='c011'>If there is any fault in his practical reasonings, it is that they are
too discursive, and without a determinate object. No difficulty ever
escapes his penetration; every view of his subject, every consequence
of his principles is stated and examined with scrupulous exactness,
and the weak sides and inconveniences of every rule are pointed out,
till a sort of sceptical uncertainty is introduced, and the mind sinks
into a passive indifference. This kind of reasoning is certainly not
calculated to rouse the energy of our active powers; but I believe it
is that which generally accompanies much dispassionate inquiry. I
am afraid the most patient thinkers are those who have the most
doubts and the fewest violent prejudices; and perhaps, after all, we
shall be forced to acknowledge with Sterne, as the truest philosophy,
‘that there is not so much difference between good and evil as the
world are apt to imagine.’ A writer, indeed, who has a system to
support, is not likely to fall into this error; but then, if it is only
because he has a system to support, what is the value of that
confidence in his opinions, which is the result of wilful blindness?
A man’s living much in retirement (as was the case with our author)
where his thoughts have a calm and even course to flow in, may
also contribute much to this indecision of mind. There is many a
champion who would soon sink into silent scepticism, if he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>urged on by the necessity of maintaining opinions which he has once
avowed, and had nobody to dispute against but himself. The spirit
of contradiction is the great source of dogmatism and pertinacity of
opinion. I am aware, that a habit of much disputing also produces
the contrary effect. But even where it renders men sceptical, it does
not render them candid. It is therefore in great cities, in literary
clubs, that you meet with the fewest sincere opinions, and the most
extravagant assertions.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to his system of belief on the subject of religion, I am unable
to say what it was: and perhaps he did not know himself. I have
however no doubt, that he was sincere in his professions of attachment
to the established doctrines, or that he was habitually accustomed to
look upon them as true. Still there is a distinction, which is not
always attended to, between that kind of assent which is merely
habitual, or the effect of choice, which depends upon a disposition
to regard any object in a certain point of view, and that internal
conviction, in which the will has no concern, which is the result of
a free and unbiassed judgment, and which a man retains in spite of
himself. Subtle distinctions are not always the most palpable; and
therefore sometimes require the aid of violent suppositions to render
them intelligible. I can conceive, that a person may all his life
live in the belief of a certain notion, without once suspecting the
contrary; yet, that if the case could be put to him, to declare his
opinion freely to the best of his judgment, for that, if he were
mistaken, his life must answer for it, he would instantly find by
what slender threads his former opinion hung. The sense of convenience,
humour, or vanity, are sufficient to blind the understanding,
and determine our opinions in speculative points, and matters of
indifference. Common compliance, or good-nature, or personal
regard, may lead them to give credit to, and defend the truth of a
story told by a friend, which yet, if I were put to my oath, I could
not do. So that we, in fact, very often believe that to be true,
which we <em>know</em> to be false.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> The atheist is no longer an atheist on
a sickbed; and a violent thunderstorm has been known not only to
clear the air, but to cure the freethinker of his affected scruples with
respect to the proofs of a superintending Providence. But the
difference of our conclusions in such cases does not arise from any
new evidence, or farther investigation of the subject, but from the
greater interest we have to examine carefully into the real state of
our opinions, and to throw off all disguises that conceal them from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>ourselves. Now this ultimate test cannot very well be applied to a
man’s religious professions, because the power of denouncing ‘pains
and penalties’ is already lodged in other hands; but I cannot help
suspecting, that if this test could have been applied to some of our
author’s notions, his external and internal, or, to use his own expressions,
his exoteric and esoteric creed, would not have been
found to coalesce perfectly together. It is amusing to observe with
what gravity he sets himself to inveigh against freethinkers and free-thinking;
when he himself, as to his mode of reasoning, is one of
the greatest of freethinkers. He seems to have been willing to
<em>keep the game</em> entirely in his own hands; or else to have supposed
that the liberal exercise of reason was only proper for gentlemen of
independent fortune; and that none but those who were in the
commission of the peace, should be allowed to censure vulgar errors.
This was certainly a weakness.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to his metaphysical system, he must be considered
as the founder of his own school; or at least, the opinions of
different sects are so mingled up in him, that he cannot be considered
as belonging to any party. He professes himself indeed,
and seems anxious to be thought, a disciple of Locke, but this is
evidently very much <em>against the grain</em>; and he is perpetually put to
it to reconcile the differences between them on the most essential
points.—I know but of two sorts of philosophy; that of those who
believe what they feel, and endeavour to account for it, and that of
those who only believe what they understand, and have already
accounted for. The one is the philosophy of consciousness, the
other that of experiment; the one may be called the intellectual,
the other the material philosophy. The one rests chiefly on the
general notions and conscious perceptions of mankind, and endeavours
to discover what the mind is, by looking into the mind itself; the
other denies the existence of every thing in the mind, of which it
cannot find some rubbishly archetype, and visible image in its
crucibles and furnaces, or in the distinct forms of verbal analysis.
The first of these is the only philosophy that is fit for men of sense,
the other should be left to chymists and logicians. Of this last
kind is the philosophy of Locke; though I would be understood to
speak of him rather as having laid the foundation, on which others
have built absurd conclusions, than of what he was in himself. He
was a man of much studious thought and reflection; and if everything
by being carried to extremes, were not converted into abuse,
his writings might have been of lasting service to his country and
mankind. He staggered under the ‘petrific mace’ of Hobbes’s
philosophy, which he had not strength to resist, but yet he attempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>to make some stand; and was not quite overpowered by the gripe
of that demon of the understanding. He took for his basis a bad
simile, that the mind is like a blank sheet of paper, equally adapted
to receive every kind of external impression. Or at least, if this
illustration was proper for the purpose to which he applied it (which
was to overturn the doctrine of innate ideas), a very bad use has
been made of it since; as if it was meant to prove, that the mind is
nothing in itself, nor the cause of any thing, never acting, but always
acted upon, the mere receiver and passive instrument of whatever
impressions are made upon it; so that being fairly <em>gutted</em> of itself,
and of all positive qualities, it in fact resembles the bare walls and
empty rooms of an unfurnished lodging, into which you bring whatever
furniture you please; and which never contains any thing more
than what is brought into it through the doors of the senses. Hence
all those superadded feelings and ideas, all those operations and
modifications which our impressions undergo from the active powers
and independent nature of the mind itself, are treated as chimerical
and visionary notions by the profound adepts in this clear-sighted
philosophy.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> The object of the German philosophy, or the system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of professor Kant, as far as I can understand it, is to explode this
mechanical ignorance, to take the subject out of the hands of its
present possessors, and to admit our own immediate perceptions to
be some evidence of what passes in the human mind. It takes for
granted the common notions prevalent among mankind, and then
endeavours to explain them; or to shew their foundation in nature,
and the universal relations of things. This, at least, is a modest
proposal, and worthy of a philosopher. The understanding here
pays a proper deference to the other parts of our being, and knows
its own place: whereas our modern sophists, meddling, noisy, and
self-sufficient, think that truth is only made to be disputed about;
that it exists no where but in their experiments, demonstrations,
and syllogisms; and leaving nothing to the silent operations of nature
and common sense, believe that all our opinions, thoughts, and
feelings, are of no value, till the understanding, like a pert commentator,
comes forward to enforce and explain them; as if a book
could be nothing without notes, or as if a picture had no meaning in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>it till it was pointed out by the connoisseur! Tucker was certainly
an arrant truant from the system he pretends to adopt, and one of the
common sense school. Thus he believed with professor Kant in the
unity of consciousness, or ‘that the mind alone is formative,’ that
fundamental article of the <em>transcendental</em> creed; in the immateriality
of the soul, etc. His chapter on consciousness is one of the best
in the whole work; and is perhaps as close an example of reasoning
as is any where to be met with. I would recommend it to the serious
perusal of all our professed <em>reasoners</em>, but that they are so thoroughly
satisfied with the profession of the thing, so fortified and wrapped up
in the mere name, that it is impossible to make any impression upon
them with the thing itself. On some other questions, which form
the great leading outlines of the two creeds, as that of self-love, for
instance, his opinions seem to have been more unsettled and wavering.
I have already offered what I have to say on this subject in a little
work published by Mr. Johnson; and I shall therefore say the less
about it here.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a> However, as I may not soon have an opportunity of
recurring to the same subject, and as there is a part of that work
with which I am not very well satisfied, the subject of which is
also treated of in the following pages, it may not perhaps be altogether
impertinent to add a few observations for the further clearing
of it up.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are told, that sympathy is only self-love disguised in another
form, that it is a mere mechanical impulse or tendency to our own
gratification. It is asked, Do we not attach ourselves to the idea of
another’s welfare, because it is pleasing to us, and do we not feel an
aversion or dislike to certain objects, whether relating to ourselves or
others, merely because they are disagreeable to us; and is not this
self-love? I answer no. Because, in this logical way of speaking,
it is a misnomer to call my attachment to any particular object or
idea by a name that implies my attachment to a general principle,
or to any thing beyond itself. Numerically and absolutely speaking,
the particular idea or modification which produces any given action,
is as much a distinct, individual, independent thing in nature, and
has no more to do with myself, that is, with other objects, and ideas
which have no immediate concern in producing it, than one individual
has to do with another. The notion that our motives are
blind mechanical impulses, if it proves anything, proves, that instead
of being always governed by self-love, there is in reality no such
thing. So that, as far as this argument goes, it is no less absurd to
trace our love of others to self-love, than it would be to account for
a man’s love of reading from his fondness for bread and butter, or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>say that his having an ear for music arose from his relish for port
wine. It is therefore necessary to suppose, that when we attempt
to resolve all our motives into self-love, we only mean to refer them
to a certain class, and to say, that they all agree in having some
circumstance in common which brings them under the same general
denomination. Now, there is one way in which this has been
attempted, by proving that they are all <em>ours</em>, that they all belong to
the same being, and are therefore all equally selfish. This is as
bad as Soame Jenyns’s argument, that all men may be said to be
born equal, because they are equally born. So, if it is contended,
that sympathy is a part of our nature, and therefore selfish; that the
imagination and understanding are real efficient causes of action,
and therefore operate mechanically; that our ideas of all external
existences, of other persons, their names, qualities and feelings, are
only impressions existing in our own minds, and are therefore
properly selfish, and ought to be called so; I shall have nothing to
object to this kind of reasoning, but that it is taking a great deal
of perverse pains to no purpose. The question stands just where
it did, it is not moved a jot further. For what difference can be
made in the question, by our calling benevolence selfishness, or
sympathy self-love, I cannot discover, except that we should lose
the advantage of having a distinct word to express those affections
and feelings which confessedly have nothing to do with sympathy.
The question therefore is, whether all our affections are of this latter
class, or whether the two words do not express a distinction which
has no real foundation in nature. This is in fact what must be meant
by saying that sympathy is self-love in disguise; for this must imply
that sympathy does not operate as such, that it is only the ostensible
motive, the accidental circumstance, the form or vehicle that serves to
transmit the efficacy of another principle lying hid beneath it, and
that has no power but what it derives from its connection with something
else. But, in order to establish this mechanical theory of self-love,
it appears to me necessary to exhibit sympathy as it were
abstracted from itself, to resolve it into another principle, and to shew
that it would still produce exactly the same effects as it does at
present. Now there are two ways in which I can conceive that
this might be satisfactorily made out, viz. if it could be shewn, first,
that our concern for others only affects the mind as connected with
physical or bodily uneasiness; or, 2ndly, as abstract uneasiness.
Suppose, for instance, that the imaginary feeling of what other
persons suffer, as far as it is confined to the mind only, does not
affect me at all, or produce the least disposition in my mind or wish
to relieve them, but that the idea of what they suffer gives me a pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>in the head, or produces an uneasiness at my stomach, and that then,
for the first time, I begin to feel some concern for them, and try to
relieve them, in order to get rid of my own uneasiness, because I do
not like the head-ach or the stomach-ach; this, I grant, would not
entitle me to the character of much disinterestedness, but however
I might attempt to gloss the matter over by an affectation of sensibility,
and make a virtue of necessity, would be downright, unequivocal
selfishness. This first supposition, however, is not true. To prove
this, I need only appeal to every one’s own breast, or at least to our
observation of human nature; for it must be clear to every person,
in one or other of these ways, that our interest in the pleasures and
pains of others is not excited in the manner here described. Besides,
how should the mind communicate an uneasiness to the body, which
it does not feel itself? We must therefore have recourse to the
second supposition for resolving benevolence into a mere mechanical
principle, or shewing that it is at bottom the same with, and governed
by the same laws as our most selfish impulses. There is no contradiction
in supposing, that however great a disposition there might be
in the mind to be immediately affected by the pleasures and pains of
others, yet the impression made upon us by them might be nothing
more than a mere abstract sensation of pleasure or pain, a simple
detached or insulated feeling, existing by itself, and operating as a
motive to action no further than the individual was concerned, or
than he was affected by it as a positive, momentary thing. This
would still be a mechanical and selfish feeling. Compassion would in
this case be an immediate repugnance or aversion of the mind to an
actual impression, and a disposition to take the shortest way to escape
from it, every thing else being a matter of perfect indifference. This
account supposes the particles of individual feeling to be as it were
drawn off by some metaphysical process, and thus disengaged from
the lifeless unsubstantial forms, to which they were attached, to bend
their whole force to remove every thing that may cause the least
disturbance or detriment to the mind to which they belong. You
must believe, on this hypothesis, that our gross material desires setting
themselves free from the airy yoke of fancy, tend directly to the
centre of self-interest, as the lead and iron work, when once disengaged
from the body of the ship, no longer float on the surface of the water,
borne about by the winds, but sink at once to the bottom. But I
have already shewn at large, and the reader may easily perceive,
that this description of the manner in which our motives operate, has
not the least foundation in nature. Our ideas and feelings act in
concert. The will cannot act without ideas, nor otherwise than as
it is directed by them. The mind is not so loosely constructed, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>that the different parts can disengage themselves at will from the
rest of the system, and follow their own separate impulses. It is
governed by many different springs united together, and acting in
subordination to the same conscious power. It is formed, that if it
could only wish to get rid of its own immediate uneasiness, it could
never get rid of it at all, because it could not <em>will</em> the necessary means
for that purpose, and would be perpetually tormented by ideal causes
of pain, without being able to exert itself to remove them. The
sore part might shrink, but the hand would not be stretched out to
remove the object that irritated it. Without allowing an elastic
power to the understanding; a power of collecting and concentrating
its forces in any direction that seems necessary; and without supposing
that our ideas have a power to act as relative representative
things, connected together in a certain regular order, and not as mere
simple pleasure and pain; the will would be entirely useless: indeed,
there could be no such thing as volition, either with respect to our
own affairs or those of others. But the fact is, that our ideas of
certain things are interwoven into the finer texture of the mind, in
a certain order and connection, as closely as the things themselves
are joined in nature; and if, as they exist and are perceived there,
they are true and efficient causes of action, I see no reason for
asserting that they act mechanically, when, by this expression, if we
affix any distinct idea to it, we must mean something entirely
different; nor for ascribing those actions and motives to self-love,
which neither take their rise from, nor are directed by, nor end in
securing the exclusive interest of the individual as a numerical unit,
a mere solitary existence. As the idea which influences the mind
is not a detached idea starting up of its own accord, but an idea
connected with other ideas and circumstances, presented involuntarily
to the mind, and which cannot be separated from one another, or the
whole of them banished from our thoughts, without overturning the
foundation of all our habits of judging and reasoning, and deranging
the understanding itself; it follows that the object of the mind, as
an intelligent and rational agent, must be, not to remove the idea
itself immediately as it is impressed on itself, but to remove those
associated feelings and ideas which connect it with the world of
external nature; that is, to make such an alteration in the relation
of external objects, as, according to the necessary connection between
certain objects and certain ideas, can alone produce the desired effect
upon the mind. Our mechanical, and voluntary motives are not
therefore the same, and it is absurd to attempt to reduce them
under the same law. They do not move in concentric spheres, but
are like the opposite currents of a river running many different ways at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>the same time. The springs that give birth to our social affections are,
by means of the understanding, as much regulated by the feelings of
others, as if they had a real communication and sympathy with them,
and are swayed by an impulse that is altogether foreign to self-love.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to return to my author: it may be expected that I should
point out some of those parts of the work which I think the
most excellent. I have already mentioned the chapter on the
nature of consciousness. That on the necessary connection of our
motives is equally admirable for the clearness and closeness of the
reasoning, though he afterwards, somehow or other, unaccountably
deserts his own doctrine. Among the chapters on subjects of
morality, some of those, which I have entitled miscellaneous, are
perhaps the best, as those on vanity, education, death, etc. The
last of these, I have sometimes conceived, has a resemblance, in a
certain peculiar style of reasoning, in which truth and sophistry are
artfully blended together, to Cicero’s beautiful little treatise on Old
Age; and, setting aside the exquisite polish of style, and gracefulness
of the manner, in which it would be ridiculous to make any
comparison with that elegant writer, I think the advantage is clearly
on the side of our author, in ingenuity and richness of illustration.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
But he has taken his boldest and most successful flight, in what he
calls the Vision; this is the most singular part of the work, and
that by which our author’s reputation as a man of genius must stand
or fall. I have given it with care, and more at large than any other
part. The best things in it are his meeting with his wife, and the
lecture delivered by Pythagoras.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had our author been a vain man, his situation would not have been
an enviable one. Even the sternest stoic of us all wishes at least
for some person to enter into his views and feelings, and confirm him
in the opinion he entertains of himself. But he does not seem to
have had his spirits once cheered by the animating cordial of friendly
sympathy. Discouraged by his friends, neglected by the public, and
ridiculed by the reviewers, he still drew sufficient encouragement
from the testimony of his own mind, and the inward consciousness
of truth. He still pursued his inquiries with the same calmness and
industry, and entered into the little round of his amusements with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the same cheerfulness as ever. He rested satisfied with the enjoyment
of himself, and of his own faculties; and was not disgusted
with his simple employments, because this made no noise in the
world. He did not seek for truth as the echo of loud folly; and
he did not desist from the exercise of his own reason, because he
could make no impression on ignorance and vulgarity. He could
contemplate the truth by its own clear light, without the aid of the
false lustre and glittering appearance which it assumes in the admiring
eyes of the beholders. He sought for his reward, where only the
philosopher will find it, in the secret approbation of his own heart,
and the clear convictions of an enlightened understanding. The man
of deep reflection is not likely to gain much popular applause; and he
does not stand in need of it. He has learned to live upon his own
stock, and can build his self-esteem on a better foundation than that
of vanity. I cannot help mentioning, that though Mr. Tucker was
blind when he wrote the last volumes of his work, which he did
with a machine contrived by himself, he has not said a word of this
circumstance: this would be with me a sufficient trait of his
character.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>PREFACE TO A NEW AND IMPROVED GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is a circumstance which may at first excite some surprise, that,
amidst the various improvements in books of modern education, there
has hitherto been no such thing as a real English Grammar. Those
which we have are little else than translations of the Latin Grammar
into English. We shall, however, no longer wonder at this circumstance,
when we recollect that the Latin Grammar was regularly
taught in our schools several centuries before any attempt was made to
introduce the study of the mother-tongue; and that even since some
attention has been paid to the latter, the study of the learned languages
still having the precedence, our first notions of grammar are necessarily
derived from them. Those who have written on the subject have
not been exempt from the influence of early prejudice, and instead of
correcting the error, have strengthened it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is an attempt to explain the principles of the English
language, such as it really is. We have endeavoured to admit no
distinctions, which, but for our acquaintance with other languages,
we should never have suspected to exist. The common method of
teaching English grammar by transferring the artificial rules of other
languages to our own, not only occasions much unnecessary trouble
and perplexity; but by loading the memory with mere technical
formalities, accustoms the mind to one of the worst habits that can
be,—that of mistaking words for things, and of admitting a distinction
without a difference. We might here refer particularly to the
accounts given, in the most approved and popular grammars, of the
genders, and the objective case of English nouns, that is, of a case
without any difference of termination, and of genders without any
mark denoting sex, &amp;c. &amp;c. In this respect the French seem to
have much the advantage of us; as their grammars are, generally
speaking, real descriptions of their language, not a fanciful and laboured
account of what has no where any existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is now above twenty years since Mr. Horne Tooke published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>his celebrated work on grammar, called the Diversions of Purley.
Though this has produced a very important change in the theory of
language, no notice has been taken of it by grammarians in their
definitions of the Parts of Speech, or in that branch of grammar
which usurps the name of Etymology—an almost inexcusable neglect
in those whose professed business it was to instruct others in the
nature and origin of language. It is the object of the following
compilation to take advantage of the discoveries contained in that
work, without adopting its errors.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The soundest and most useful parts of Mr. T.’s system, are his
researches into the origin of indeclinable words, and we have engrafted
the result of most of these into our little work, so far at
least as to make the subject intelligible to the learner, though if we
have merely excited his curiosity, we shall not have entirely failed in
our object.</p>

<p class='c011'>The practical rules and observations in the following work are
almost entirely selected from other works of the same kind: if it
should be thought to have any advantage over them, it must be
chiefly in the theoretical and logical part. We shall here therefore
present the reader with a short general view of the subject, to enable
him to judge in what we differ from others, and whether it is for the
better or worse.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is common to suppose that the parts of speech, or different
sorts of words, relate to different sorts of things or ideas; and that
it was to express this difference in the subject-matter of discourse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>that one class of words was originally appropriated to one class of
things, and another to another. We have endeavoured to show on
the contrary, that the grammatical distinctions of words do not relate
to the nature of the things or ideas spoken of, but to our manner of
speaking of them, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> to the particular point of view in which we
have occasion to consider them, or combine them with others in the
same discourse. The difference between a substantive and an adjective
for instance, does not depend on the intrinsical nature of the
object we think or speak of, but on its being that concerning which
we affirm something, or that which we affirm of it. So if we say
that snow is white, snow, the name of the subject of discourse, is a
substantive, and white, the name of the quality we attribute to it, is
an adjective, not because snow is a substance, and white a quality,
for we may speak of a snowy mountain, or say that whiteness is
hurtful to the eyes, when these words will change their character,
though the things themselves cannot. The things themselves do not
change, but it is we who view them in a different connection with
other things, and who accordingly use different sorts of words to
show the difference of the situation which they occupy in our
thoughts and discourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>The article is generally left quite unexplained, a mere anomaly in
language. We have endeavoured to show that it is either the
numeral adjective (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un</span></i>, one) or that it belongs to the same class
with the demonstrative pronouns, <em>this</em>, <em>that</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>A substantive had been generally supposed to be a word expressing
a real thing or substance, as A man, a tree, a house, &amp;c. It was
however found that this definition would exclude many words from
being substantives, which are universally allowed to be so; for
example, all words expressing qualities, actions, abstract ideas,
&amp;c. &amp;c. such as, Whiteness, conquest, kingdom, virtue. The only
definition which in common grammars has been substituted for this
circumscribed one is as much too loose and general: for a substantive
is defined by Lowth, Murray, &amp;c., to be the name of any thing that
exists, or of which we can form any notion. So that all words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>
all signs of our ideas, must be substantives. We believe that a substantive
is neither the name of a thing, nor the name of a substance,
but the name of a substance or of any other thing or idea, considered
as it is in itself, or as a distinct individual. That is, it is not the
name of a thing really subsisting by itself (according to the old
definition), but of a thing <em>considered</em> as subsisting by itself. So if we
speak of <em>white</em> as a circumstance or quality of snow, it is an adjective;
but if we abstract the idea of <em>white</em> from the substance to which it
belongs, and consider this colour as it really is in itself, or as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>distinct subject of discourse, it then becomes a substantive, as in the
sentence, White or whiteness is hurtful to the sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjectives are constantly defined as if they were the names of
certain qualities, and of no other class of ideas. It is evident from
what has been said that this definition is fallacious. We speak of a
<em>stony</em> road, a <em>golden</em> mountain, a <em>leather</em> girdle, where the words marked
in italics, and which refer to the substance of which a thing is made,
not to its qualities, are confessedly adjectives. Any idea or thing,
considered as a circumstance belonging to or connected with another,
may be an adjective. An adjective therefore differs from a substantive,
not from its expressing some <em>quality</em> of a substance, but from its
expressing any thing that is affirmed of or connected with another, to
wit, its quality, number, form, size, substance, situation, &amp;c. &amp;c., as
may be seen in the instances, A <em>white</em> horse, A <em>tenth</em> part, A <em>round</em>
table, A <em>small</em> book, An <em>iron</em> crown, A <em>sea</em> port. On the other hand,
the characteristic difference between the adjective and the verb is, that
the former expresses something that is usually known to belong to a
thing, or which is taken for granted as a circumstance belonging to
it; whereas the latter or the verb expresses something not usually
belonging to a thing, or known to make a part of it, and which
therefore forms the subject of a distinct proposition. The use of the
adjective is to describe or define the subject of discourse, that of the
verb to <em>mark</em> any addition which the speaker wishes to make to it,
or any circumstance respecting it which it is his immediate object to
enforce upon the hearer. So if we speak of a ‘<em>poisonous</em> plant,’ we
take for granted the connection between the subject and the attribute
as a thing of course, or as already understood; but if we say, ‘hemlock
<em>poisons</em>, or <em>is poisonous</em>,’ we then distinguish this connection of ideas
as one which we suppose the hearer to be ignorant of, or which we
particularly wish to recal to his attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have been led unintentionally in speaking of the adjectives to
anticipate our account of the verb. Nothing can be more vague,
unsatisfactory and confused than the definition commonly given of the
last, namely, that it is a word signifying To be, To do, or To suffer.
From this definition the student may be tempted to suppose that
Being, Doing, and Suffering are three particular classes of ideas,
which are always expressed by the verb, and by no other part of
speech. Let us examine how far this is the case. To love, then, is
a verb, because it expresses Being, Doing, or Suffering. Love (the
substantive) is not a verb, and yet it surely expresses either Being,
Doing, or Suffering. Battle, Conquest, &amp;c., are the names of
actions, yet they are not verbs, but substantives. Active, Hasty,
Cowardly, are adjectives, all of them expressing Action, Suffering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Being, or a state of being. In fact, those who have made and
adopted this definition, have sheltered its weakness under an ambiguous
form of expression. If they had said that a verb is a word signifying
Being, Doing, or Suffering, their account would not have been
admitted. The prefix of the infinitive mood (To be, To do, &amp;c.)
is the only resemblance which the definition has to the subject.
Instead of defining the verb, they make use of one. It remains
however to show in what respect To Be, To Do, and To Suffer
differ from Being, Doing, and Suffering. It cannot be in the subject-matter,
or the ideas themselves, for these are the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some persons have confined the signification of the verb to action.
See Introduction to an Analytical Dictionary by David Booth. But
this hypothesis, which is more determinate than the other, and at
least aims at a meaning, is hardly tenable. The verb To Be does
not express action. To belong to, To possess, To contain, To
extend over, &amp;c., do not express action, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> motion or change. Not
to say that other classes of words, as nouns and adjectives, express
action as well as verbs, as we have shown above. It would be better
to say that a verb expresses some fact or event, that is to say, Being,
Doing, or Suffering, as distinguished from a state of Being, Doing, or
Suffering. But neither do all verbs express a single act or instance
of a thing. When we say Two and two make four, we do not mean
they do so in a single instance, but always. It is true, however, that
verbs oftener express what happens to a thing, than what belongs to
it, and that they do not express any proposition more generally than
the nature of the subject requires. They make any thing known in
a more marked and pointed, and therefore in a more limited manner.
This secondary quality in the verb, however, seems to form the chief
distinction between the participle and the adjective. Those indeed
who make the participle an essential part of the verb, must adopt the
definition here referred to, <em>viz.</em> that a verb is a word signifying a single,
not a general attribution of one thing to another, or the actually being,
doing, or suffering any thing, as distinct from a state of being, doing,
or suffering. If we were to adopt any other definition of the verb
than the one we have inserted, it would certainly be this. But we
think it more consistent both with the particular meaning of words,
and with the logic of grammar, to divide adjectives and verbs into
words intended to express a <em>given</em>, or known connection between our
ideas, and words intended to communicate a new or unknown one,
than into words representing a continued connection between the
subject and the attribute, and an accidental or momentary one.</p>

<p class='c011'>We shall here just notice by the way the very unsatisfactory
account of active and passive verbs given by grammarians. A verb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>is active, they say, when it denotes the doing of an action, passive
when it denotes the receiving one. The words <em>To receive a blow</em> will
upon this principle signify the doing of an action, and to say <em>that an
action is performed</em> will signify the receiving one. In fact the notion
of agency or passiveness has no necessary connection with the active
and passive forms of verbs. For an attempt to explain this subject,
we refer to the grammar itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>A pronoun is a general term to express an individual. Thus by
the words He, she, it, I, you, &amp;c., we mean that particular person
or thing, which occupies a certain situation in the discourse, the
person speaking, or the person spoken to, &amp;c. A pronoun is literally
a word used instead of, or which supplies the place of a noun, because
instead of mentioning the name of the individual, we only refer to
it by some known circumstance of situation which ascertains the
object we mean. Pronouns are therefore adjectives defining some
circumstance of a thing, and put absolutely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adverbs are for the most part words expressing the circumstance,
manner, degree, &amp;c., of an action, or attribute. Some of them,
however, as the words No, Yes, are properly abbreviations of whole
sentences, that is, convey assent to or dissent from an entire proposition.
The last of these words is in fact the French verb, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ouis</span></i>, <em>I
hear</em>, used as an indeclinable term, that is, a term having a definite
sense and meaning like declinable words, but not varied to adapt it
to different situations, because it is restricted by custom to a particular
application. The same account may be given of the other indeclinable
words. Prepositions and conjunctions are either nouns
or verbs expressing certain ideas like other nouns and verbs, but
which are now used only for a particular purpose, and in a particular
manner; that is to say, they are abruptly inserted between other
words or sentences to join them together, and point out some such
abstract relation between them as is implied in the original words
themselves. So when we say All except John, we do not mean
to address ourselves formally to any person who is to except or leave
out John, though the preposition Except is undoubtedly the imperative
mood of the same verb. We merely mean to convey the
abstract idea, that John is to be excepted from the observation we
have made, or that what is true of the others is not true of him. So
the word From is a noun originally signifying Beginning, and now
inserted before another noun to point it out as the source, cause, or
first instance of any thing: as He speaks <em>from</em> (source) inspiration,
or inspiration being the <em>cause</em> of his speaking. Interjections are the
last class of indeclinable words, and they admit of a similar explanation.
For they are merely words, conveying some sudden burst of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>passion, and left standing by themselves without any regular connection
with the rest of the discourse. We also give an interjectional
form to half sentences, when we are hurried on by passion into the
middle of what we mean to express without making any preparation,
as ‘Oh virtue! how amiable thou art! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> <em>I cannot express</em> how
amiable thou art.’</p>

<p class='c011'>We have thus gone through the different parts of the subject, in
order to enable those who are conversant in such questions, to judge
at one view of the merits or demerits of our plan. It is, we confess,
a little different from others. But those, whose time is chiefly
occupied in learning grammar, whether Latin or English, are not
very strongly prejudiced in favour of established systems. The
imperfections of those systems are obvious and unquestionable; and
therefore an assiduous endeavour to improve upon them, and to place
the fundamental articles of grammatical knowledge on a clearer and
more intelligible footing without implicitly subscribing to error and
absurdity merely because they are old, can scarcely fail to be received
with favour, and examined with fairness, by competent judges.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>A REPLY TO THE ESSAY ON POPULATION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Thomas Robert Malthus’s (1766–1834) <cite>Essay on the Principle of Population as it
affects the Future Improvement of Society</cite> was published anonymously in 1798. The
second edition ‘very much enlarged’ appeared with the author’s name in a large
4to volume in 1803. For a sketch of Malthus’s life and doctrine and of the
Malthusian controversy, see Sir Leslie Stephen’s <cite>The English Utilitarians</cite>, II. 137–185
and 238–259. The references in the following notes are to the second (1803)
edition of the Essay. Cf. Hazlitt’s essay on Malthus in <cite>The Spirit of the Age, ante</cite>,
pp. 287–298, and the last five essays in <cite>Political Essays</cite>, vol. III. pp. 356–385.
A paper by De Quincey, entitled ‘Malthus,’ in the <cite>London Magazine</cite> for Oct. 1823,
led to a brief controversy between De Quincey and Hazlitt, the particulars of
which will be found in De Quincey’s <cite>Works</cite> (ed. Masson), IX. pp. 3, 20–31.
Hazlitt’s <cite>Reply to Malthus</cite> was reviewed in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for August 1810
(vol. xvi. p. 464), or rather, as Hazlitt complains, the title of his <cite>Reply</cite> was prefixed
to an article in the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> ‘as a pretence for making a formal eulogy’ on
Malthus’s work. Hazlitt thereupon wrote the following letter to Cobbett’s
<cite>Political Register</cite> (Nov. 24, 1810, vol. xviii. p. 1014) under the heading ‘Mr.
Malthus and the Edinburgh Reviewers’:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—The title-page of a pamphlet which I published some time ago, and part
of which appeared in the Political Register in answer to the Essay on Population,
having been lately prefixed to an article in the Edinburgh Review as a pretence for
making a formal eulogy on that work, I take the liberty to request your insertion
of a few queries, which may perhaps bring the dispute between Mr. Malthus’s
admirers and his opponents, to some sort of issue. It will, however, first of all be
proper to say something of the article in the Review. The writer of the article
accuses the ‘anonymous’ writer of the reply to the Essay, of misrepresenting and
misunderstanding his author, and undertakes to give a statement of the real
principles of Mr. Malthus’s work. He at the same time informs us for whom
this statement is intended, namely, for those who are not likely even to read the
work itself, and who take their opinions on all subjects moral, political, and
religious, from the periodical reports of the Edinburgh Review. For my own part,
what I have to say will be addressed to those who have read Mr. Malthus’s work,
and who may be disposed to form some opinion of their own on the subject.—The
most remarkable circumstance in the Review is, that it is a complete confession of
the force of the arguments which have been brought against the Essay. The
defence here set up of it may indeed be regarded as the euthanasia of that performance.
For in what does this defence consist but in an adoption, point by point, of
the principal objections and limitation, which have been offered to Mr. Malthus’s
system; and which being thus ingeniously applied to gloss its defects, the Reviewer
charges those who had pointed them out with misrepresenting and vilifying the
author? In fact, the advocates of this celebrated work do not at present defend
its doctrines, but deny them. The only resource left them is that of screening its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>fallacies from the notice of the public by raising a cry of misrepresentation against
those who attempt to expose them, and by holding a mask of flimsy affectation
over the real and distinguishing features of the work. Scarcely a glimpse remains
of the striking peculiarities of Mr. Malthus’s reasoning, his bold paradoxes dwindle
by refined gradations into mere harmless common-places, and what is still more
extraordinary, an almost entire coincidence of sentiment is found to subsist between
the author of the essay and his most zealous opponents, if the ignorance and
prejudices of the latter would but allow them to see it. Indeed the Edinburgh
Reviewer gives pretty broad hints that neither friends nor foes have ever understood
much of the matter, and kindly presents his readers for the first time, with
the true key to this much admired production. He accordingly proceeds with
considerable self-complacency to translate the language of the essay into the
dialect of the Scotch school of economy, to put quite on one side the author’s
geometrical and arithmetical ratios, which had wrought such wonders, to state
that Mr. Malthus never pretended to make any new discovery, and to quote a
passage from Adam Smith, which suggested the plan of his work; to shew that
this far-famed work which has been so idly magnified, and so unjustly decried
as overturning all the commonly received axioms of political philosophy, proves
absolutely nothing with respect to the prospects of mankind or the means of social
improvement, that the sole hopes either of the present or of future generations do
not centre (strange to tell!) in the continuance of vice and misery, but in the
gradual removal of these, by diffusing rational views of things and motives of
action, and particularly by ameliorating the condition, securing the independence,
and raising the spirit, of the lower classes of society; and finally that both the
extent of population, and the degree of happiness enjoyed by the people of any
country depend very much upon, and, as far as there is any difference observable
between one country or state of society and another, are wholly regulated by
political institutions, a good or bad government, moral habits, the state of civilization,
commerce, or agriculture, the improvements in art or science, and a variety
of other causes quite distinct from the sole mechanical principle of population.
And, this Sir, is what the Reviewer imposes on his unsuspecting readers as the
sum and substance, the true scope and effect of Mr. Malthus’s reasoning. It is in
truth an almost literal recapitulation of the chief topics insisted on in the Reply to
the Essay, which the Reviewer seems silently to regard as a kind of necessary
supplement to that work.—In this account it is evident, both that Mr. Malthus’s
pretentions as an original discoverer are given up by the Reviewer, and that his
obnoxious and extravagant conclusions are carefully suppressed. Now with regard
to the general principle of the disproportion between the power of increase in
population, and in the means of subsistence, and the necessity of providing some
checks, moral or physical, to the former, in order to keep it on a level with the
means of subsistence, I have never in any instance called in question either of
“these important and radical facts,” which it is the business of Mr. M.’s work
to illustrate. All that I undertook in the Reply to the Essay was to disprove
Mr. Malthus’s claim to the discovery of these facts, and to shew that he had
drawn some very false and sophistical conclusions from them, which do not appear
in the article in the Review. As far therefore as relates to the Edinburgh
Reviewers, and their readers, I might consider my aim as accomplished, and leave
Mr. Malthus’s system and pretensions in the hands of these friendly critics, who
will hardly set the seal of their authority—on either one or the other, till they
have reduced both to something like their own ordinary standard. But against
this I have several reasons. First, as I never looked upon Mr. Malthus as “a
man of no mark or likelihood,”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a> I should be sorry to see him dandled into insignificance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>and made a mere puppet in the hands of the Reviewers. Secondly, I in
some measure owe it to myself to prove that the objections I have brought against
his system are not the phantoms of my own imagination. Thirdly, Mr. Malthus’s
work cannot be considered as entirely superseded by the account of it in the
Review, as there are, no doubt, many persons who will still take their opinion of
Mr. Malthus’s doctrines from his own writings, and abide by what they find in the
text as good authority and sound argument, though not sanctioned in the Commentary.—I
will therefore proceed to put the questions I at first proposed as the
best means I can devise for determining, both what the contents of Mr. Malthus’s
work really are, and to what degree of credit they are entitled, or how far they are
true or false, original or borrowed.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The queries which follow were with a few alterations republished by Hazlitt in
<cite>The Examiner</cite> (Oct. 29, 1815—The <cite>Round Table</cite>, No. 23) and in <cite>Political Essays</cite>
(vol. <span class='fss'>III.</span> pp. 381–5). The alterations are almost entirely confined to the omission
of all reference to the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, for which Hazlitt himself had begun to
write in 1814. The letter concludes as follows: ‘The drift of these questions, is,
I believe, sufficiently obvious and direct; but if they should not be thought clear
enough in themselves, I am ready to add a suitable commentary to them, by
collating a convenient number of passages from the Essay, the Reply, and the
Review.’</p>

    Yorkshire 1784–1812, and for Bramber 1812–1825, was early converted to the evangelical
    party known as the ‘Clapham Sect’ or the ‘Saints,’ and became the parliamentary leader of
    the anti-slavery cause. The slave trade was abolished by the coalition government in
    1807, and emancipation was carried in 1833, the year of Wilberforce’s death. Apart from
    his efforts in this cause and on behalf of missionary work in India, he gave a general
    support to the Tory ministries of Pitt (his intimate friend), and of the Duke of
    Portland, Perceval, and Lord Liverpool. In particular he approved the coercive measures
    of 1795 and 1817. This partly accounts for the bitter attack not only of Hazlitt, but of
    Cobbett (<cite>Political Register</cite>, Aug. 1823).

    characters of Coleridge, etc., he had done better in former publications, the praise and
    abuse much stronger, etc., but the new ones are capitally done. Horne Tooke is a

    has laid too many colours on my likeness; but I have had so much injustice done me in my

    think proper to bestow.’ In a letter to J. Taylor (<cite>Letters</cite>, ed. Ainger,

<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The late Sir W. Pulteney, whose character for liberality is well known, was
firmly persuaded that the author of the Essay on Population was the greatest man
that ever lived, and really wished to have bestowed some personal remuneration on
Mr. M. as his political confessor, for having absolved him from all doubts and
scruples in the exercise of his favourite virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Among the former are Hume, Wallace, Smith, and Price; among the latter
are the Economists, Montesquieu, Franklin, Sir James Steuart, Arthur Young,
Mr. Townshend, Plato, and Aristotle.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. I beg leave to refer the reader to some letters which appeared on this subject,
in the Monthly Magazine, written by a well informed and ingenious man, who
had too much good sense and firmness to be carried away by the tide of vulgar
prejudice.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Yet it is extraordinary that with all their wisdom and virtue they would not
be able to take any steps to prevent this distress. This is a species of fascination,
of which it is difficult to form any conception.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The prevalence of this check may be estimated <em>by the general proportion</em> of
virtue and happiness in the world, for if there had been no such check there could
have been nothing but vice and misery.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. In the second edition, it says, <em>moral restraint</em>, vice or misery. What are we
to think of a man who writes a book to prove that vice and misery are the only
security for the happiness of the human race, and then writes another to say, that
vice and folly are not the only security, but that our only resource must be either
in vice and folly, or in wisdom and virtue? This is like making a white skin
part of the definition of a man, and defending it by saying that they are all <em>white</em>,
except those who are <em>black</em> or <em>tawny</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. I here follow the text of Mr. Malthus, who takes great pains to give a
striking description of the savage tribes, as a pleasing contrast, no doubt, to the
elegancies and comforts of polished life. Mr. Malthus’s extreme sensibility to the
grossness and inconveniences of the savage state, may be construed into refinement
and delicacy. But it does not strike me so. There is something in this
mis-placed and selfish fastidiousness, that shocks me more than the objects of it.
It does not lead to compassion but to hatred. We strive to get rid of our
uneasiness, by hardening ourselves towards the objects which occasion it, and lose
the passive feelings of disgust excited in us by others in the active desire to inflict
pain upon them. Aversion too easily changes into malice. Mr. Malthus
seems fond of indulging this feeling against all those who have not the same
advantages as himself. With a pious gratitude he seems fond of repeating to
himself, ‘I am not as this poor Hottentot.’ He then gives you his bill of
fare, which is none of the most delicate, without omitting a single article, and by
shrugging up his shoulders, making wry mouths at him, and fairly turning your
stomach, excites in you the same loathing and abhorrence of this poor creature
that he takes delight in feeling himself. ‘Your very nice people have the nastiest
imaginations.’ He triumphs over the calamities and degradation of his fellow-creatures.
He lays open all the sores and blotches of humanity with the same
calmness and alacrity as a hospital surgeon does those of a diseased body. He
turns the world into a charnel-house. Through a dreary space of 300 ‘chill and
comfortless’ pages, he ransacks all quarters of the globe only ‘to present a speaking
picture of hunger and nakedness, in quest of objects best suited to his feelings,
in anxious search of calamities most akin to his <em>invalid</em> imagination,’ and eagerly
gropes into every hole and corner of wretchedness to collect evidence in support of
his grand misery-scheme, as at the time of an election, you see the city-candidates
sneaking into the dirty alleys, and putrid cellars of Shoreditch or Whitechapel,
and the candidates for Westminster into those of St. Giles’s, canvassing for
votes, their patriotic zeal prevailing over their sense of dignity, and sense of smell.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. I mention these names because it is always customary to mention them in
speaking on this subject: and there are some readers who are more impressed with
a thing, the oftener it is repeated.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. I here leave out of the question, as not essential to it, the effect of sudden
rises or falls, and other accidental variations in the produce of a country which
cannot be foreseen or provided against, on the state of population.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. I find there is here some transposition of names and circumstances, but it does
not much matter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. I am happy to find that a philosophical work, like Mr. Malthus’s, has got a
good deal into the hands of young ladies of a liberal education and an inquisitive
turn of mind. The question is no doubt highly interesting; and the author has
thrown over it a warmth of colouring, that can hardly fail to please. Even Miss
Howe was fond of ardours.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. I have here purposely left an opening for Mr. Malthus’s ingenuity. He will
I hope take the hint and write another quarto volume to prove by anatomical and
medical inquiries into the state of all countries, beginning at the north and ending
at the south pole, that there is the same variation in the quantity and kind of food
required by the human stomach in different climates and countries, as there is in
the quantity of sexual indulgence.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. Such a change would not require the perfect subjugation, or rather annihilation
of these passions, or perfect virtue, in the literal sense, as Mr. Malthus seems to
imply in a late publication—which I have not read. It might as well be pretended
that no man could ever keep his fingers off bank-notes, or pay his debts, who was
not perfectly honest. In neither case is there required any thing more than such
a superiority in one set for motives over another, from pride, habit, example,
opinion, &amp;c. as just to incline the balance. The gentlemen of the society of Lloyd’s
fund would no doubt scorn to touch a shilling of the money entrusted to their care:
yet we should hardly conclude from hence that they are all of them persons of
perfectly disinterested characters, and altogether indifferent to money-matters.
The Turks, it is said, who are very far from the character of perfection, leave their
goods for sale on an open stall, and the buyer comes and takes what he wants, and
leaves the money on the stall. Men are not governed by extreme motives. If
perfect virtue were necessary to common honesty, fair dealing, and propriety of
conduct, there would be nothing but swindlers and black-guards in the world.
Men steer clear of the law not so much through fear, as because it stamps the
public opinion. It is a positive thing. If men could make up their minds as
decidedly about the general characters and conduct of individuals without, as they
do with, the rough rebuke of the law to sharpen their moral sense (to which by the
bye Mr. Godwin’s plan of plain speaking would contribute not a little) this would
go a great way towards rendering a system of equality practicable. But I meddle
with these questions only as things of idle speculation. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jactet se in aulis, &amp;c.</span></i></p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. This is a work which I would recommend to every reader of whatever party,
not only for the knowledge it contains, but for the purity, simplicity, and noble
dignity of the style. It smacks of the old Roman elevation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. I should like to know whether Mr. Malthus would go so far as to say that
all the wars and rebellions occasioned by religion, that all the plots, assassinations,
burnings, massacres, the persecutions, feuds, animosities, hatreds and jealousy of
different sects, that the cruelty, bigotry, the pernicious customs, and abominable
practices of the Pagan and other superstitions, such as human sacrifices, &amp;c. whether
all those mischiefs and enormities of which religion has been made a tool, whether
the martyrdom of the first christians, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the fires of
Smithfield, the expeditions to the holy land, the Gunpowder Plot, the Inquisition,
the long Parliament, the Reformation and the Revolution,—Popery, Protestantism,
monks, eremites, and friars, with all their trumpery’ were the offspring of the
principle of population.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. See the ingenious and elegant defence of the Slave-Trade, attributed in the
newspapers to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence. There is a magnanimity
and noble ingenuousness in the avowal of such a sentiment, which can only be
expected from those, who from the elevated superiority of their situation can look
down with contempt on the opinion of mankind, and the vulgar notions of decency
and order.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. Mr. Malthus, for what reason I know not, in his account of the state of
population in the different countries of modern Europe, has declined giving any
account of the state of population in Italy.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. Among other instances it is mentioned, that every vassal was obliged to give
the first night of his bride to the lord of the manor, if he demanded it. It is hard
to be sure for a man to be cuckolded the very first night of his marriage. But
even at present, though the formality of the thing is abolished, there are very few
husbands who are not tolerably certain of being cuckolded by the first lord, or duke,
who thinks it worth his while to attempt it. It is some consolation to us poor
devils of authors, that we have no chance of getting a wife who is at all likely to
meet with any such distinction. But if I were a snug tradesman or city-merchant,
and had bargained for a sweet girl whose smile was Elysium, whose air was
enchantment, and her looks all love,—I should be terribly afraid of the cocked
hats at the opera. I should tremble at every coronet coach that passed the door,
and should run mad at the sight of a prince’s feather.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. Even this is making a very large concession to Mr. Malthus. The real points
to be given are the possible power of productiveness in the earth and the necessary
tendency of population to increase.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. Mr. M. always translates the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">misere</span></i> or want misery, and has adopted it as
the burthen of his song. He has made a very significant use of this equivoque in
many parts of his work.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The engrafting of trees might be mentioned as an instance in point.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Dr. Paley, of whose depth or originality I have in general but a slender
opinion, has made one very shrewd and effectual observation in reply to Hume’s
argument upon miracles; which is, that according to Hume’s reasoning, miracles
must be <em>equally</em> inadmissible and improbable, whether we believe in a superintending
Providence or not. There must therefore be some fallacy in an argument,
which completely sets aside so material a consideration. I would recommend this
answer, which I think a true and philosophical one, to Mr. Malthus’s attention, as
it may perhaps lead him ‘to new-model some of his arguments’ about experience.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. It is to no purpose to object, that they would hinder the poor from increasing
in proportion. This would be merely a negative check,—preventing the
increase on one side, but setting no bounds to it on the other. Besides, not having the
poor to work for them, they must work for themselves. Neither can it be said
that property is a fluctuating thing, that changes hands, and passes from the rich to
the poor and from the poor back again to the rich, still keeping up the same
inequality; for the greatest wealth would soon be melted down by the principle of
population, and it is only by the accumulation and transmission of property in
regular descents that any great inequality can subsist. Mr. Malthus wishes to
preserve the balance of society by hindering the poor from marrying; perhaps it
would be preserved as effectually by forcing the rich to marry.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Thus the shop-keeper cannot in general be supposed to be actuated by any fear
of want. His exertions are animated entirely by the prospect of gain, or advantage.
Yet how trifling are his profits compared with those of the merchant. This
however does not abate his diligence. It may be said that the advantage is as
great to him. That is, it is the greatest in his power to make; which is the very
thing I mean to say. In fact we are wound up to a certain pitch of resolution
and activity almost as mechanically as we wind up a clock.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. The immediate rise in the price of manufactured articles upon any rise in the
price of labour is either a foolish impatience of loss, or a trick to make the
labourer refund his own earnings by paying more for what he wants himself, and
by being <em>pigeoned</em> by others that they may be able to pay the additional price. It
has nothing to do with a fair and liberal determination to raise the price of
labour, which of itself, and if not immediately counteracted by the power and
artifices of the rich must always tend to the benefit of the labouring part of the
community.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. This is something like Mr. Godwin’s saying, he does not regard a new-born
infant with any peculiar complacency. They both differ from the founder of the
Christian religion, who has said, Bring unto me little children. But modern
philosophers scorn to pin their faith on musty sayings.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. But a moment ago the subject was involved in the most profound obscurity,
and great advantages were expected from the manner in which Mr. Malthus was
to bring it home to each man’s comprehension. In the passage immediately
following the above, our author quotes Dr. Paley’s Moral Philosophy, and as he
often refers to this work, I shall here take the liberty of entering my protest against
it. It is a school in which a man learns to tamper with his own mind, and will
become any thing sooner than an honest man. It is a directory, shewing him how
to disguise and palliate his real motives (however unworthy) by metaphysical
subterfuges, and where to look for every infirmity which can beset him, with its
appropriate apology, taken from the common topics of religion and morality. All
that is good in Paley is taken from Tucker; and even <em>his</em> morality is not the most
bracing that can be imagined.</p>

the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy representation of
manners which has been just laid before the reader. It is grievous to think that
those valiant Barons, to whose stand against the crown the liberties of England
were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such dreadful
oppressors, and capable of excesses, contrary not only to the laws of England, but
to those of nature and humanity. But alas! we have only to extract from the
industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected from
contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly reach the dark
reality of the horrors of the period.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the cruelties
exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and lords of castles,
who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the excesses of which they were
capable when their passions were inflamed. “They grievously oppressed the poor
people by building castles; and when they were built, they filled them with
wicked men or rather devils, who seized both men and women who they imagined
had any money, threw them into prison, and put them to more cruel tortures
than the martyrs ever endured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended
others by the feet, or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. They
squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while
they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and toads.”

the description.’—<cite>Henry’s Hist.</cite> edit. 1805, vol. vii. p. 346.</p>

simple and mild in his manner, deliberate and unruffled in his speech, though some
of his expressions were not very qualified. His figure is tall and portly: he has a
good sensible face—rather full, with little grey eyes, a hard, square forehead,
a ruddy complexion, with hair grey or powdered; and had on a scarlet broad-cloth
waistcoat, with the flaps of the pockets hanging down, as was the custom for
gentlemen-farmers in the last century, or as we see it in the pictures of Members

<p class='c011'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. In this age of solid reason, it is always necessary to refer to particular
examples, as it was formerly necessary to explain all hard words to the ladies.
Condillac, in his Logic, that favourite manual of the modern sciolist, with
admirable clearness proves, that our idea of virtue is a sensible image; because
virtue implies a law, and that law must be written in a book, which must consist
of letters, or figures of a certain shape, colour, and dimensions, which are real
things, the objects of sense: that we are therefore right in asserting virtue to have
a real existence, namely on paper, and in supposing that we have some idea of it,
that is, as consisting of the letters of the alphabet. Mr. Horne Tooke, a man of
wonderful wit, knowledge, and acuteness, but who, with my consent, shall not be
empanelled as a juror to decide upon any question of abstruse reasoning, has
endeavoured to explain away the whole meaning of language, by doing away its
habitual or customary meaning, by denying that words have any meaning but
what is derived to them from the umbilical root which first unites them to matter;
and by making it out, that our thoughts having no life or motion in them, but
as they are dragged about mechanically by words, are ‘just such shard-born beetle
things’</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Tooke’s description of the formation of language<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> is a sort of pantomime
or masquerade, where you see the trunks of our abstract ideas going about in
search of their <em>heads</em>, or clumsily setting on their own <em>noses</em>, and afterwards
pointing to them in answer to all questions: it reminds you of the island of
Pantagruel (or some such place), where the men carry their heads before them</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. See his account of the terminations head and ness, or nez.
in their hands, or you would fancy that our author had lately been at the
Promontory of noses. Andrew Paraeus, on the solution of noses, was a novice
to him. I am a little uneasy at this scheme of reducing all our ideas to points and
solid substances. It is like the project to the philosopher, who contended that
all the solid matter in the universe might be contained in a nutshell. This is
ticklish ground to tread upon. At this rate, and if the proportion holds, each
man will hardly have a single particle of understanding left to his share; and in
two large quarto volumes, there may not perhaps be three grains of solid sense.
Mr. Tooke, as a man of wit, may naturally wish to turn every thing to <em>point</em>. But
this method will not hold in metaphysics: it is necessary to spin the thread of our
ideas a little finer, and to take up with the flimsy texture of mental appearances.
It is not easy to philosophize in solid epigrams, or explain abstruse questions by the
tagging of points. I do not, however, mean to object to Mr. Tooke’s etymological
system as an actual history of language, but to that superficial gloss of philosophy
which is spread over it, and to the whole of his logic: I might instance in the
axiom, on which the whole turns, that ‘it is as absurd to talk of a complex idea as
of a complex star.’ Now this and such like phrases had better have been left out:
it is a good antithesis, but it is nothing more. Or if it had been put into the
mouth of Sir Francis, who is a young man of lively parts, and then gravely
answered by Mr. Tooke, it would have been all very well. But as it stands, it
is injurious to the interests of philosophy, and an affront to common sense.
Hartley proceeded a good way in making a dissected map of the brain; and did
all he could to prove the human soul to consist of a white curd. After all, he
was forced to confess, that it was impossible to get at the mind itself; and he was
obliged to rest satisfied with having spent many years, and wasted immense
ingenuity, in ‘vicariously torturing and defacing’ its nearest representative in
matter. He was too great a man not to perceive the impossibility of ever reconciling
matter and motion with the nature of thought; and he therefore left
his system imperfect. But it fell into good hands, and soon had all its deficiencies
supplied, and its doubts cleared up, to the entire satisfaction and admiration of all
the dull, the superficial, and the ignorant.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f71'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. Essay on Human Action.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. There is one argument in defence of Old Age, in Cicero, which is so exquisitely
put, that nothing can surpass it: it is a perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon bouche</span></i> for a metaphysician. It
is where some one objects to old age, that the old man, whatever comforts he may
enjoy, cannot hope to live long, which the young man at least expects to do. To
which is answered: So much the better; the one has already done what the other
only hopes to do: the old man has already lived long: the young man only hopes
that he may. A man would be happy a whole day after having such a thought
as this.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. Mr. Tooke has fallen into the same mistake with which he reproaches
preceding writers, that of supposing the different sorts of words to be the measure
of the different sorts of things. He has only reversed their inference: for as the
old grammarians, who admitted more different sorts of words, contended for
more differences of things, so Mr. Tooke, who admits of fewer sorts of words,
argues that there can be only as many different ideas or things, as are expressed
by the different parts of speech. Thus, if substantives and adjectives do not
represent substance and quality, there can be no such difference in nature, or in the
human understanding. This we conceive to be a piece of as false philosophy,
as if we were to affirm that there can be no difference between blue or yellow,
because they are both adjectives, or between light and sound, because they are
both substantives. Mr. Tooke’s whole object is to show that the different parts
of speech do not relate to the differences in ideas or things, and yet he would make
the difference in the one, the test of the difference in the other. As to all that he
has said of abstraction, and the real or physical meaning of words, we believe that
we do not understand him; for, as far as we do, his facts and cases seem to us
to prove the very reverse of his conclusions. So he has brought 2000 instances of
the meaning of words to demonstrate that we have no abstract ideas, not one of
which 2000 meanings is any thing else but an abstract idea. Logic and metaphysics
are the weak sides of his reasoning. But he has rendered essential services
to grammar, which cannot be overlooked or forgotten.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
